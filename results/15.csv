Math,1a,"Question: Christine and Rachel went strawberry picking.  They want to make pies and need 3 pounds of strawberries per pie.  Christine picked 10 pounds of strawberries and Rachel picked twice as much as Rachel.  Together, how many pies can they make?
Answer: Christine picked 10 pounds and Rachel picked twice as much, so Rachel picked 10*2 = <<10*2=20>>20 pounds of strawberries
Christine picked 10 pounds and Rachel picked 20 pounds for a combined total of 10+20 = <<10+20=30>>30 pounds of strawberries
They need 3 pounds of strawberries to make 1 pie and they have 30 pounds so they can make 30/3 = <<30/3=10>>10 strawberry pies

Question: Jack is trying to stack cans in his emergency bunker. If he can fit 12 cans in one row, 4 rows on one shelf, and 10 shelves in one closet, how many cans can he store in each closet?
Answer: First find the total number of cans Jack can fit on one shelf: 12 cans/row * 4 rows/shelf = 48 cans/shelf
Then find the number of cans he can fit on all the shelves in one closet: 48 cans/shelf * 10 shelves = <<48*10=480>>480 cans

Question: Zoey and Sydney are having a watermelon seed spitting contest. Whoever spits their seeds the most total distance wins. They each get one watermelon. Zoey's has 40 seeds and she spits each one 10 feet. Sydney's has 35 she spits each one 12 feet. What is the average total distance spat?","Answer: First, find the total distance Zoey's seeds are spit: 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet
Then find the total distance Sydney's seeds are spit: 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet
Then add the two distances together: 400 feet + 420 feet = <<400+420=820>>820 feet
Finally, divide the total distance by the number of participants to find the average distance: 820 feet / 2 people = <<820/2=410>>410 feet per person","Zoey spits a total distance of 400 feet because 40 x 10 = <<40*10=400>>400
Sydney spits a total distance of 420 feet because 35 x 12 = <<35*12=420>>420
This totals to 820 feet because 400 + 420 = <<400+420=820>>820
The average total distance is 410 because 820 / 2 = <<820/2=410>>410

Math,1a,"Question: Patricia and Geoffrey went fishing to feed their group of campers. They caught an eight-pound trout, six two-pound bass, and two twelve-pound salmon. If each person will eat two pounds of fish, how many campers can they feed?
Answer: The bass weigh 6 * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 pounds in all.
The salmon weigh 2 * 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 pounds in all.
The trout, bass, and salmon together weigh 8 + 12 + 24 = <<8+12+24=44>>44 pounds.
Each camper will eat 2 pounds of fish, so Patricia and Jeffrey can feed 44 / 2 = <<44/2=22>>22 campers.

Question: DJ Snake's friends decided to give him treats to celebrate his engagement. Moksi took him and his fiancee to a luxurious hotel for two nights at $4000 per night. Lil Jon bought them a car worth $30000, and Wynter presented them with a house worth four times the value of the car Lil Jon bought them. What was the total value of all the treats DJ Snake received on his engagement day?
Answer: Moksi took DJ Snake and his fiancee to a luxurious hotel for two nights at $4000 per night, for a total of 2*$4000 = $<<2*4000=8000>>8000
If Lil Jon also bought them a car worth $30000, the value of the treats from Lil John and Moksi summed up to $8000+$30000 = $<<8000+30000=38000>>38000
Wynter presented them with a house worth four times the value of the car Lil Jon bought them, a total of 4*$30000 = $<<4*30000=120000>>120000
The total value of all the treats DJ Snake received on his engagement day is $120000+$38000 = $<<120000+38000=158000>>158000

Question: Zoey and Sydney are having a watermelon seed spitting contest. Whoever spits their seeds the most total distance wins. They each get one watermelon. Zoey's has 40 seeds and she spits each one 10 feet. Sydney's has 35 she spits each one 12 feet. What is the average total distance spat?","To find the total distance spat by Zoey, we multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed was spat: 40 seeds * 10 feet = 400 feet.
To find the total distance spat by Sydney, we multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed was spat: 35 seeds * 12 feet = 420 feet.
Adding the total distances spat by Zoey and Sydney together, we get 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.
To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by the number of contestants: 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet.
Therefore, the average total distance spat is 410 feet.","Zoey spits a total distance of 400 feet because 40 x 10 = <<40*10=400>>400
Sydney spits a total distance of 420 feet because 35 x 12 = <<35*12=420>>420
This totals to 820 feet because 400 + 420 = <<400+420=820>>820
