Math,0,"Question: Christina records her mood every day on a calendar. Over the past thirty days of moods, she had twelve good days and eight bad days and the rest were neutral. Her first eight days were good, her second eight days were bad, and her third eight days were neutral. If the next three days were good, neutral, and good, how many good days were left in the month?","Based on the information provided, Christina had 12 good days over the span of 30 days. She had 8 good days in the first 8 days, so in the next 8 days there were 8-8=0 good days.
In the next 8 days, there were 8-0=8 neutral days.
Thus far, we know that there are 12 good days, 8 neutral days, and 8 bad days accounted for.
For the next three days: 1 good day, 1 neutral day, and 1 good day.
Therefore, the total number of good days at the end of the month is 12 (known good days) + 1 (from the next 3 days) = 13 good days left in the month.","Christina had 30 - 12 - 8 = <<30-12-8=10>>10 neutral days in the month.
After the first three 8-day periods, she had 30 - 8 * 3 = 30 - 24 = <<30-8*3=6>>6 days of moods left.
Of those days, 12 - 8 = <<12-8=4>>4 days were good.
After the next 3 days with 2 good days, Christina had 4 - 2 = <<4-2=2>>2 good days left.

Answer: Jim gave 8*13 = <<8*13=104>>104 trading cards to his brother.
Jim gave 5*13 = <<5*13=65>>65 trading cards to his sister.
Jim gave 2*13 = <<2*13=26>>26 trading cards to his friends.

Question: Jude bought three chairs for his house, all at the same price. He also bought a table that costs $50 and two sets of plates at $20 for each set. After giving the cashier $130, Jude got a $4 change. How much did each of the chairs cost?
Answer: The two sets of plates amount to $20 x 2 = $<<20*2=40>>40.
So the table and the two sets of plates amount to $50 + $40 = $<<50+40=90>>90 in all.
Since Jude received a $4 change, then he paid a total of $130 - $4 = $<<130-4=126>>126 for the chairs, tables, and plates.
Thus, the three chairs cost $126 - $90 = $<<126-90=36>>36.
Therefore, each chair cost $36/3 = $<<36/3=12>>12.

This leaves 12 - 8 - 3 = <<12-8-3=1>>1 good day left for the rest of the month.
Therefore, there is 1 good day left for the remainder of the month.
#### 1","Christina had 30 - 12 - 8 = <<30-12-8=10>>10 neutral days in the month.
