Math,1a,"Question: Bill is laying power cable for a new neighborhood. There are going to be 18 east-west streets that are 2 miles long and 10 north-south streets that are four miles long. It takes 5 miles of cable to electrify 1 mile of street. If cable costs $2000/mile, what is the total cost of cable for the neighborhood?
Answer: First find the total distance of the east-west streets: 18 streets * 2 miles/street = <<18*2=36>>36 miles
Then find the total distance of the north-south streets: 10 streets * 4 miles/street = <<10*4=40>>40 miles
Then add the number of miles from each type of street to find the total distance: 36 miles + 40 miles = <<36+40=76>>76 miles
Then multiply that number by 5 to find the number of miles of cable needed: 76 miles street * 5 miles cable/mile street = <<76*5=380>>380 miles of cable
Then multiply that number by the cost of one mile of cable to find the total cost: 380 miles * $2000/mile = $<<380*2000=760000>>760,000

Question: Calum runs a nightclub and decides to run a disco night to attract different customers. He is planning the event and is calculating how much he can spend on each item without spending more than he has budgeted. He only needs to buy 4 disco balls and 10 boxes of food. Each box of food costs $25. Calum’s budget for the disco balls and food is $330. How much, in dollars, can Calum afford to spend on each disco ball?
Answer: The food is going to cost Calum a total of 10 boxes of food * $25 per box of food = $<<10*25=250>>250.
This leaves $330 budget - $250 spent on food = $<<330-250=80>>80 to spend on disco balls.
Calum can therefore afford to spend $80 remaining budget / 4 disco balls = $<<80/4=20>>20 on each disco ball.

Q: A basic manicure starts at $35 while a pedicure starts at $40. A certain salon offers 20% off if you get both. Suppose Karen chooses to do both and would also like to add nail art on each of her fingers, which costs $3 per nail. How much would she pay in all?","A basic manicure costs $35 and a pedicure costs $40, so without the discount, Karen would pay $35 + $40 = $75 for both services.
The salon offers a 20% discount for getting both services, which would be a discount of $75 * 0.20 = $15.
After the discount, Karen would pay $75 - $15 = $60 for both the manicure and pedicure.
Adding nail art on each finger would cost $3 per nail and since there are 10 fingers, Karen would pay $3 * 10 = $30 for nail art.
Therefore, in total, Karen would pay $60 + $30 = $90 for both services with nail art. 
Karen would pay $90 in all.","The cost for both manicure and pedicure is $35+$40=$<<35+40=75>>75.
The discount is $75*0.2=$<<75*0.2=15>>15.
So, Karen would only pay $75-$15=$<<75-15=60>>60 for both services.
The cost of the nail art for 10 fingers is $3*$10=$<<3*10=30>>30.
Therefore, Karen would pay a total of $60+$30=$<<60+30=90>>90.

Math,1a,"Question: On Blacks, Martha goes to the mall to buy clothes on sale. For every 2 jackets she buys, she gets 1 free jacket. For every 3 t-shirts she buys, she gets 1 free t-shirt. Martha decides to buy 4 jackets and 9 t-shirts. How many clothes will she take home?
Answer: For buying 4 jackets Martha gets 4 jackets / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 jackets for free
For buying 9 t-shirts, Martha gets 9 t-shirts/ 3 = <<9/3=3>>3 t-shirts for free
Adding the free jackets, Martha gets 4 jackets + 2 jackets = <<4+2=6>>6 jackets
Adding the free t-shirts, Martha gets 9 t-shirts + 3 t-shirts = <<9+3=12>>12 t-shirts.
In total, Martha will take home 6 jackets + 12 t-shirts = <<6+12=18>>18 clothes

Question: Connor wanted to order some new books to read.  The website was offering free shipping over $50.00.  They also had a deal that when you buy 4 books; the first two were 25% off.  Book 1 cost 13.00 and Book 2 cost 15.00.  Book 3 & 4 were both $10.00 each.  How much more money did Connor need to spend to receive free shipping?
Answer: Book 1 was $12.50 and book 2 was $15.00 so 13.00 +15.00 = $28.00
He was buying 4 books, so these 2 were 25% off so 28.00 * .25 = $7.00
These two books came out to 28-7 = $<<28-7=21.00>>21.00
Books 3 & 4 were both $10 each so 2*10 = $20.00
When you add all 4 books together, 21+20 = $<<21+20=41.00>>41.00
To get free shipping he would need to spend 50-41 = $<<50-41=9.00>>9.00 more on books

Suppose Karen chooses to do both and would also like to add nail art on each of her fingers, which costs $3 per nail. How much would she pay in all?","A basic manicure cost $35 and a pedicure cost $40, so without any discounts or add-ons, Karen would pay $35 + $40 = $75.
Since Karen is getting both a manicure and a pedicure, she is eligible for a 20% discount. The total cost of both services is $75, and a 20% discount would be 0.20 * 75 = $15.
After the discount, Karen would pay $75 - $15 = $60 for both the manicure and pedicure.
If Karen wants to add nail art to each of her fingers, which costs $3 per nail and she has 10 fingers altogether, the total cost of the nail art would be $3 * 10 = $30.
Therefore, in total, Karen would pay $60 (for the manicure and pedicure) + $30 (for the nail art) = $90. 
Karen would pay a total of $90 for her manicure, pedicure, and nail art.","The cost for both manicure and pedicure is $35+$40=$<<35+40=75>>75.
The discount is $75*0.2=$<<75*0.2=15>>15.
So, Karen would only pay $75-$15=$<<75-15=60>>60 for both services.
The cost of the nail art for 10 fingers is $3*$10=$<<3*10=30>>30.
Therefore, Karen would pay a total of $60+$30=$<<60+30=90>>90.
