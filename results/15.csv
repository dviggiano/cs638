Math,0,"Question: A DVD can be played 1000 times before it breaks. There are two DVDs in the public library, one has been played 356 times and the other has been played 135 times. How many total times can both DVDs be played before they break?","Both DVDs can be played a total of 865 times before they break. 

The first DVD has been played 356 times, so it can be played 644 more times before it breaks (1000 - 356 = 644). 

The second DVD has been played 135 times, so it can be played 865 more times before it breaks (1000 - 135 = 865). 

Therefore, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 644 (first DVD) + 865 (second DVD) = 1509 times.","1000-356=<<1000-356=644>>644 times

Math,1a,"Question: Marites internet speed is 10 megabits per second and her monthly internet bill is $20. Marites is planning to upgrade her service and choosing between 20 Mbps and 30 Mbps. If the price of the 30 Mbps is twice the amount of her current monthly bill and the price of the 20 Mbps is $10 more than her current monthly bill, how much will she save per year if she chooses the 20 Mbps than 30 Mbps?
Answer: The total monthly bill for 30 Mbps is $20 x 2= $<<20*2=40>>40.
She will have to pay $40 x 12 = $<<40*12=480>>480 every year for 30mbps.
The total monthly bill for 20 Mbps is $20 + $10= $<<20+10=30>>30.
So, she will have to pay $30 x 12 = $<<30*12=360>>360 for 20 Mbps per year.
Therefore the amount she will save per year if she chooses the 20mbps is $480 - $360 = $<<480-360=120>>120

The number of emails that were not spam emails is 400-100 = <<400-100=300>>300
2/5 of the emails which were not spam were promotional emails, a total of 2/5*300=<<2/5*300=120>>120 emails.

Each day, the 5 of them planted a total of 200/2 = <<200/2=100>>100 flowers.

Question: Edith is a receptionist at a local office and is organizing files into cabinets. She had 60 files and finished organizing half of them this morning. She has another 15 files to organize in the afternoon and the rest of the files are missing. How many files are missing?
Answer: Edith has already organized 60 files / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 files in the morning.
She has files left to organize so she must still have 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 files in the office.

Since each DVD can be played 1000 times before breaking, both DVDs can be played a total of 1000 + 1000 = <<1000+1000=2000>>2000 times before they break.
Therefore, both DVDs can still be played a total of 2000 - 491 = <<2000-491=1509>>1509 times before they break.
