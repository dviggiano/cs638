Math,0,"Question: John is raising money for a school trip. He has applied for help from the school, which has decided to cover half the cost of the trip. How much money is John missing if he has $50 and the trip costs $300?","John has $50 and the school is covering half of the cost of the trip. This means the school will cover $150 of the $300 trip cost. 

Therefore, John will still need to come up with $150 on his own. 

So, John is missing $150 to cover the total cost of the trip.","John's school has decided to pay 300 / 2 = $<<300/2=150>>150 for his trip.
In total John has covered 150 + 50 = $<<150+50=200>>200 for his trip
Therefore, John needs 300 - 200 = $<<300-200=100>>100 more for the trip.

Math,1a,"Question: Jack makes his own cold brew coffee.  He makes it in batches of 1.5 gallons.  He drinks 96 ounces of coffee every 2 days.  It takes 20 hours to make coffee.  How long does he spend making coffee over 24 days?
Answer: He makes it in batches of 1.5*128=<<1.5*128=192>>192 ounces
He drinks 96/2=<<96/2=48>>48 ounces of coffee a day
So he drinks the coffee in 192/48=<<192/48=4>>4 days
So in 24 days he makes 24/4=<<24/4=6>>6 batches
That means he spends 6*20=<<6*20=120>>120 hours making coffee

Question: There are 10 books on the table. Two-fifths of them are reading books and three-tenths of them are math books. There is one fewer science book than math books and the rest are history books. How many history books are there?
Answer: Out of the 10 books, 10 x 2/5 = <<10*2/5=4>>4 are reading books.
While 10 x 3/10 = <<10*3/10=3>>3 are math books.
There are 3 - 1 = <<3-1=2>>2 science books.
So, the total number of reading, math, and science books is 4 + 3 + 2 = <<4+3+2=9>>9.
Thus, there is only 10 - 9 = <<10-9=1>>1 history book.

StrategyQA,0,"Question: Giraffes are much taller than other land animals. Giraffe shelters at zoos must be built larger than shelters for other animals to accommodate their height.
Do giraffes require special facilities at zoos?","Yes, giraffes do require special facilities at zoos due to their unique physical characteristics and behavior. Some of the special facilities and considerations for giraffes at zoos include:

1. Taller shelters: As mentioned, giraffe shelters need to be taller than shelters for other animals to accommodate their height. Giraffes also need ample space to move around comfortably and exhibit natural behaviors.

2. High-quality diet: Giraffes have specialized dietary needs, as they primarily feed on leaves and buds from tall trees. Zoos must provide a diet rich in fiber and with the appropriate balance of nutrients to ensure the health of their giraffes.

3. Enrichment activities: Giraffes are social animals that thrive in environments that provide mental and physical stimulation. Zoos often provide enrichment activities such as puzzle feeders, sensory experiences, and opportunities for social interaction to keep giraffes engaged and healthy.

4. Veterinarian care: Giraffes need regular veterinary care to monitor their health and address any medical issues that may arise. Zoos have specialized staff and facilities to provide medical care for giraffes, including regular check-ups, vaccinations, and treatments.

Overall, zoos must provide specialized facilities and care to meet the unique needs of giraffes and ensure their health and well-being in captivity.",True
