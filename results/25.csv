Math,1a,"Question: James watched 2 episodes of Jeopardy and 2 episodes of Wheel of Fortune.  Jeopardy is 20 minutes and Wheel of Fortune is twice as long.  How many hours did he watch TV?
Answer: He watched 2*20=<<2*20=40>>40 minutes of Jeopardy.
Wheel of Fortune is 2*20=<<2*20=40>>40 minutes each.
So he watched it for 40*2=<<40*2=80>>80 minutes.
So he watched 40+80=<<40+80=120>>120 minutes of TV.
That means he watched 120/60=<<120/60=2>>2 hours of TV.

Question: In a classroom of 81 students, two-thirds are wearing striped shirts while the others are wearing checkered shirts. If there are 19 more students wearing shorts than checkered shirts, how many more students are wearing striped shirts than shorts?
Answer: 81/3 = <<81/3=27>>27 students are wearing checkered shirts.
27 x 2 = <<27*2=54>>54 students are wearing striped shirts.
27 + 19 = <<27+19=46>>46 students are wearing shorts.
54 - 46 = <<54-46=8>>8 more students are wearing striped shirts than shorts.

Question: A basic manicure starts at $35 while a pedicure starts at $40. A certain salon offers 20% off if you get both. Suppose Karen chooses to do both and would also like to add nail art on each of her fingers, which costs $3 per nail. How much would she pay in all?","Answer: The total cost of the manicure and pedicure without any discounts or add-ons is $35 + $40 = $75.
Karen receives a 20% discount for getting both services, so she pays 80% of the original cost, which is 0.80 x $75 = $60.
Adding nail art on each finger would cost $3 x 10 = $30.
Therefore, Karen would pay a total of $60 + $30 = $90 in all.","The cost for both manicure and pedicure is $35+$40=$<<35+40=75>>75.
The discount is $75*0.2=$<<75*0.2=15>>15.
So, Karen would only pay $75-$15=$<<75-15=60>>60 for both services.
The cost of the nail art for 10 fingers is $3*$10=$<<3*10=30>>30.
Therefore, Karen would pay a total of $60+$30=$<<60+30=90>>90.

Math,1a,"Question: There are twice as many centipedes as humans on a certain island and half as many sheep as humans. How many sheep and humans in total are on the island if the number of centipedes is 100?
Answer: The number of humans on the island is 100 / 2 = <<100/2=50>>50.
There are 1/2 * 50 = <<1/2*50=25>>25 sheep on the island.
The total number of sheep and humans is 25 + 50 = <<25+50=75>>75.

Question: Tom needs to lower a rope down 6 stories.   One story is 10 feet.  The only rope being sold is 20 feet long but you lose 25% when lashing them together.  How many pieces of rope will he need to buy?
Answer: He needs 10*6=<<10*6=60>>60 feet
He loses 20*.25=<<20*.25=5>>5 feet each time
So he gets 20-5=<<20-5=15>>15 feet from each piece
That means he needs 60/15=<<60/15=4>>4 pieces of rope

Suppose Karen chooses to do both and would also like to add nail art on each of her fingers, which costs $3 per nail. How much would she pay in all?","Answer: The total cost of the manicure and pedicure without the discount would be $35 + $40 = $75.
With the 20% discount, she would pay 0.2 * $75 = $<<0.2*75=15>>15 less.
So, her total cost after the discount would be $75 - $15 = $60.
To add nail art on each finger, she would pay $3 * 10 = $<<3*10=30>>30.
Therefore, Karen would pay a total of $60 + $30 = $<<60+30=90>>90 in all.","The cost for both manicure and pedicure is $35+$40=$<<35+40=75>>75.
The discount is $75*0.2=$<<75*0.2=15>>15.
So, Karen would only pay $75-$15=$<<75-15=60>>60 for both services.
The cost of the nail art for 10 fingers is $3*$10=$<<3*10=30>>30.

Question: A basic manicure starts at $35 while a pedicure starts at $40. A certain salon offers 20% off if you get both. Suppose Karen chooses to do both and would also like to add nail art on each of her fingers, which costs $3 per nail. How much would she pay in all?","Answer: The total cost of the basic manicure and pedicure before the discount is $35 (manicure) + $40 (pedicure) = $75.
Karen will get a 20% discount on $75, which is 0.20 * $75 = $15.
So, the discounted price for both services is $75 - $15 = $60.
Adding nail art to each finger (assuming 10 fingers) will cost $3 * 10 = $30.
Therefore, Karen will pay $60 (for manicure and pedicure) + $30 (for nail art) = $90 in all.","The cost for both manicure and pedicure is $35+$40=$<<35+40=75>>75.
The discount is $75*0.2=$<<75*0.2=15>>15.
So, Karen would only pay $75-$15=$<<75-15=60>>60 for both services.
The cost of the nail art for 10 fingers is $3*$10=$<<3*10=30>>30.
