Math,0,"Question: Rory orders 2 subs for $7.50 each, 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each and 2 cookies for $1.00 each for delivery.  There’s a 20% delivery fee added at check out and she wants to add a $5.00 tip.  What will her delivery order cost?","First, calculate the total cost of the subs, chips, and cookies:
2 subs x $7.50 = $15.00
2 bags of chips x $1.50 = $3.00
2 cookies x $1.00 = $2.00

Total cost of food = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, calculate the delivery fee:
20% of $20.00 = 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

Add the delivery fee to the total cost of the food:
$20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, add the $5.00 tip to get the total delivery order cost:
$24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

The delivery order will cost $29.00.","2 subs are $7.50 each so that’s 2*7.50 = $<<2*7.5=15.00>>15.00
2 bags of chips are $1.50 each so that’s 2*1.50 = $<<2*1.50=3.00>>3.00
2 cookies are $1.00 each so that’s 2*1 = $<<2*1=2.00>>2.00
Her delivery order will be 15+3+2= $<<15+3+2=20.00>>20.00
There’s a 20% delivery fee on the $20.00 which adds .20*20 = $4.00 to her bill
The delivery order is $20.00, there’s a $4.00 delivery fee and she adds a $5.00 tip for a total of 20+4+5 = $<<20+4+5=29.00>>29.00

Math,1a,"Question: Tim spent $50.00 on Chinese take-out.  80% of the cost went to 4 entrees.  The rest of the money went to 2 appetizers that each cost the same amount.  How much was the price of a single appetizer?
Answer: He spent $50.00 and 80% of the meal went to entrees so he spent 50*.80 = $40.00 on entrees
He spent $50.00 and $40.00 went to entrees so that leaves $50 - $40 = $<<50-40=10.00>>10.00 for appetizers
Each appetizer costs the same amount and he spent $10.00 all together so each appetizer is $10/2 = $<<10/2=5.00>>5.00

Question: If eight liters is 20% the capacity of a container filled with water, calculate the total capacity of 40 such containers filled with water.
Answer: If eight liters is 20% the capacity of a container filled with water, when the container is full, which is 100%, the container will contain 100%/20% * 8 liters= 40 liters.
The total capacity of 40 such containers filled with water is 40*40 = <<40*40=1600>>1600 liters

Question: Rory orders 2 subs for $7.50 each, 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each and 2 cookies for $1.00 each for delivery.  There’s a 20% delivery fee added at check out and she wants to add a $5.00 tip.  What will her delivery order cost?","First, let's calculate the cost of the subs, chips, and cookies. 

2 subs at $7.50 each = 2 * $7.50 = $15.00
2 bags of chips at $1.50 each = 2 * $1.50 = $3.00
2 cookies at $1.00 each = 2 * $1.00 = $2.00

The total cost of the subs, chips, and cookies is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, let's calculate the delivery fee, which is 20% of $20.00:
Delivery fee = 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

Now, let's add the delivery fee and the tip to the total cost:
Total cost = $20.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

Therefore, Rory's delivery order will cost $29.00.","2 subs are $7.50 each so that’s 2*7.50 = $<<2*7.5=15.00>>15.00
2 bags of chips are $1.50 each so that’s 2*1.50 = $<<2*1.50=3.00>>3.00

Math,1b,"Question: A school cafeteria uses ground mince to cook lasagnas and cottage pies. They make 100 lasagnas, which use 2 pounds of ground mince each, and cottage pies, which use 3 pounds of ground mince each. If the cafeteria has used 500 pounds of ground mince in total, how many cottage pies did they make?
Answer: The cafeteria used 100 lasagnas * 2 pounds of ground mince = <<100*2=200>>200 pounds of ground mince for the lasagnas.
This means they used 500 pounds of ground mince in total – 200 pounds of ground mince for the lasagnas = 300 pounds of ground mince for the cottage pies.
So they must have made 300 pounds of ground mince for the cottage pies / 3 pounds of ground mince per cottage pie = <<300/3=100>>100 cottage pies.

Question: Charlotte is making a pie. She can't decide if she will make cherry or blueberry. So she decides to make whichever pie is cheapest. Both pies will need $2 for flour, $1 for sugar and $1.5 for eggs and butter to make the crust. The blueberry pie needs 3 pounds of blueberries. The blueberries come in 8 oz containers for $2.25. For the cherry pie, she needs 4 pounds and they come in a four-pound bag for $14. What is the total price to make the cheapest pie?
Answer: The crust will cost $4.5 because 2 + 1 + 1.5 = <<2+1+1.5=4.5>>4.5
She will need 6 containers for blueberries because 3 x (8/16) = 6
The blueberries will cost $13.5 because 6 x 2.25 = <<6*2.25=13.5>>13.5
The blueberries are cheaper because 13.5 < 14
The blueberry pie will cost $18 to make because 4.5 + 13.5 = <<4.5+13.5=18>>18

There’s a 20% delivery fee added at check out and she wants to add a $5.00 tip.  What will her delivery order cost?","First, let's calculate the total cost of the subs, chips, and cookies before the delivery fee and tip:

2 subs at $7.50 each = 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
2 bags of chips at $1.50 each = 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
2 cookies at $1.00 each = 2 x $1.00 = $2.00

Total cost of the food items = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, let's calculate the delivery fee, which is 20% of the total cost of the food items:

Delivery fee = 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the delivery order including the delivery fee and tip:

Total cost = Total cost of food items + Delivery fee + Tip
Total cost = $20.00 + $4.00 + $5.00

This means they used 500 pounds of ground mince in total – 200 pounds of ground mince for the lasagnas = 300 pounds of ground mince for the cottage pies.
