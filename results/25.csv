Math,1a,"Question: There are 6 times as many lab coats as uniforms in the lab. The number of lab techs is half of the number of uniforms. If there are 12 uniforms in the lab, and the lab techs share the coats and uniforms equally among them, how many coats and uniforms in total does each lab tech get?
Answer: If there are 12 uniforms, and the lab coats are 6 times as many as the number of uniforms, there are 6*12 = <<12*6=72>>72 lab coats.
The total number of lab coats and uniforms in the lab is 72+12 = <<72+12=84>>84
If the number of lab techs is half the number of uniforms, then there are 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 lab techs
If they share the lab coats and uniforms equally, each lab tech will get 84/6 = <<84/6=14>>14 lab coats and uniforms.

Question: Geli is committed to her 3 times a week workout. On her first day, she started doing 10 push-ups. Her fitness trainer encouraged her to add 5 more push-ups each day. How many push-ups will she do in total throughout her first week?
Answer: On the first day, she will do 10 push-ups.
On the second day, she will do 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 push-ups.
On the third day, she will do 15 + 5 = <<15+5=20>>20 push-ups.
So, Geli will do a total of 10 + 15 + 20 = <<10+15+20=45>>45 push-ups in a week.

Q: Grandma walks 3 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 2 miles of walking on the beach and 1 mile of walking on the sidewalk.  On the sidewalk, Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach.  If 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 3-mile walk, in minutes?","A: Since Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk, the total distance she walks is 3 miles.

If she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, and the sidewalk is walked at twice the speed of the beach, then she spends 40 / 2 = 20 minutes walking on the sidewalk.

Therefore, Grandma takes 40 + 20 = 60 minutes to complete her 3-mile walk.
#### 60","On the beach, Grandma walks at a rate of 2 miles per 40 minutes, or 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.
On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2 * 1/20 = 1/10 miles per minute.
To walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, it takes her 1/(1/10) = <<1/(1/10)=10>>10 minutes.
Thus, in total, it takes Grandma 40+10 = <<40+10=50>>50 minutes to walk her favorite route.

Question: The pirates plan to explore 4 islands. Two islands require walking 20 miles per day while the other two islands require 25 miles per day. How many miles will they have to walk if it takes 1.5 days to explore each island?
Answer: It will take 1.5 days x 2 = <<1.5*2=3>>3 days to explore 2 islands.
So, the pirates will walk 20 miles x 3 days = <<20*3=60>>60 miles to explore two islands.
The other 2 islands will be explored by walking 25 miles x 3 days = <<25*3=75>>75 miles.
Thus, the pirates will need to walk 60 + 75 = <<60+75=135>>135 miles to explore the 4 islands.

Q: Grandma walks 3 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 2 miles of walking on the beach and 1 mile of walking on the sidewalk.  On the sidewalk, Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach.  If 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 3-mile walk, in minutes?","A: Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, which is 2 miles, so she walks at a rate of 2/40 = 0.05 miles per minute.
This means on the sidewalk she walks at 0.05 x 2 = 0.1 miles per minute.
To walk 1 mile at 0.1 miles per minute, it will take 1/0.1 = 10 minutes.
So, Grandma completes the 3-mile walk in 40 + 10 = <<40+10=50>>50 minutes.","On the beach, Grandma walks at a rate of 2 miles per 40 minutes, or 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.
On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2 * 1/20 = 1/10 miles per minute.
To walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, it takes her 1/(1/10) = <<1/(1/10)=10>>10 minutes.
Thus, in total, it takes Grandma 40+10 = <<40+10=50>>50 minutes to walk her favorite route.

If there are 12 uniforms in the lab, and the lab techs share the coats and uniforms equally among them, how many coats and uniforms in total does each lab tech get?
Answer: If there are 12 uniforms, and the lab coats are 6 times as many as the number of uniforms, there are 6*12 = <<12*6=72>>72 lab coats.
The total number of lab coats and uniforms in the lab is 72+12 = <<72+12=84>>84
If the number of lab techs is half the number of uniforms, then there are 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 lab techs

So, the pirates will walk 20 miles x 3 days = <<20*3=60>>60 miles to explore two islands.
The other 2 islands will be explored by walking 25 miles x 3 days = <<25*3=75>>75 miles.

If 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 3-mile walk, in minutes?","A: If Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, which is 2 miles, then she walks 2 miles/40 minutes = 1 mile per 20 minutes on the beach.
Since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, she walks 1 mile in half the time, which is 20 minutes on the sidewalk.
Therefore, Grandma completes the entire 3-mile walk in 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes.
So, it takes Grandma 60 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk.","On the beach, Grandma walks at a rate of 2 miles per 40 minutes, or 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.
On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2 * 1/20 = 1/10 miles per minute.
To walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, it takes her 1/(1/10) = <<1/(1/10)=10>>10 minutes.

If 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 3-mile walk, in minutes?","A: Since Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk, and spends 40 minutes on the beach, she walks 2 miles in 40 minutes.

If she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, then she would walk 1 mile in half the time it takes her on the beach, which would be 40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes.

Therefore, Grandma spends 40 + 20 = <<40+20=60>>60 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk.","On the beach, Grandma walks at a rate of 2 miles per 40 minutes, or 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.
On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2 * 1/20 = 1/10 miles per minute.
To walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, it takes her 1/(1/10) = <<1/(1/10)=10>>10 minutes.

On the sidewalk, Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach.  If 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 3-mile walk, in minutes?","A: If Grandma spends 40 minutes on the beach (2 miles), then she spends 40/2 = 20 minutes per mile on the beach.
Since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk compared to the beach, she spends 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 minutes per mile on the sidewalk.
Therefore, it takes Grandma 10 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, and since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, it will take her 10 minutes to complete that part of the walk.
In total, it will take Grandma 40 minutes on the beach + 10 minutes on the sidewalk = <<40+10=50>>50 minutes to complete the 3-mile walk.
So, it will take Grandma 50 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk.","On the beach, Grandma walks at a rate of 2 miles per 40 minutes, or 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.
