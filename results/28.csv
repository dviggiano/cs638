Question: The average GPA for 6th graders is 93, the 7th graders is 2 more than the 6th graders and the 8th graders average GPA is 91.  What is the average GPA for the school?
Answer: The 7th graders average GPA is 2 more than the 6th graders GPA of 93 so 93+2 = 95
If you combine the GPA for all three grades then they have 93+95+91 = <<93+95+91=279>>279
The average GPA for the school is 279/3 = <<279/3=93>>93

Q: Shiela bought five cell phones for $150 each for a 3-month installment. A 2% interest will be charged for each unit. How much will Shiela pay each month for 3 months?","A: The total cost of the five cell phones is $150 x 5 = $750.
A 2% interest will be charged on each unit, so the total interest for all five phones is $750 x 2% = $15.
Therefore, the total amount Shiela needs to pay over 3 months is $750 + $15 = $765.
Dividing this total over 3 months, Shiela will pay $765 / 3 = $255 each month. 

Therefore, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months.","A $150 x 2/100 = $<<150*2/100=3>>3 interest will be charged for each unit.
So, each cell phone costs $150 + $3 = $<<150+3=153>>153.
The total amount to be paid for 5 cell phones is $153 x 5 = $<<153*5=765>>765.
Thus, Shiela will pay $765/3 = $<<765/3=255>>255 each month.
