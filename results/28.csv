Math,0,"Question: Carmen goes to an auction to win an antique desk. She accepts the opening bid of $200 and continues bidding until she wins. The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time and 3 other people each bid once. Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people and eventually wins. How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her?","Carmen accepted the opening bid of $200 and bids after each of the 3 other people. Since the bids rise by $50 each time, Carmen's bids will be $200 + $50 = $250 after the first person bids.
After the second person bids, Carmen's bid will be $250 + $50 = $300.
After the third person bids, Carmen's bid will be $300 + $50 = $350.
Therefore, to win the antique desk, Carmen will have to pay $350.","3 other people are bidding on the desk so there are 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 added to the cost of the desk by other people.
Carmen also has to bid against each person, so she also adds 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 to the overall cost.
So in these bids, there has been a total of $150 + $150 = $<<150+150=300>>300 added to the initial cost of the desk.
The desk therefore costs $200 opening bid + $300 added cost = $<<200+300=500>>500.

Math,1a,"Question: Daisy’s milk cow provides 16 cups of milk per day.  75% of the milk is consumed by Daisy’s kids.  Daisy uses 50% of the remaining milk to cook with.  How much milk is left over?
Answer: The cow provides 16 cups of milk per day and the kids consume 75% so they drink 16*.75 = <<16*.75=12>>12 cups of milk
The cow provides 16 cups of milk and the kids drink 12 cups leaving 16-12 = <<16-12=4>>4 cups of milk
Daisy uses 50% of the remaining 4 cups of milk to cook with so she uses .50*4 = <<50*.01*4=2>>2 cups of milk
She had 4 cups of milk and used 2 cups to cook with so that leaves 4-2 = <<4-2=2>>2 cups of milk

Question: Olaf is sailing across the ocean with 25 men, including himself. He needs 1/2 a gallon of water per day per man. The boat can go 200 miles per day and he needs to travel 4,000 miles. How many gallons of water does he need?
Answer: He needs 12.5 gallons per day because 25 x .5 = <<25*.5=12.5>>12.5
It will take 20 days of travel because 4,000 / 200 = <<4000/200=20>>20
He will need 250 gallons of water because 20 x 12.5 = <<20*12.5=250>>250

The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time and 3 other people each bid once. Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people and eventually wins. How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her?","Answer: The opening bid was $200 and each subsequent bid increases by $50, so the total number of bids must be 200 + 50n, where n is the number of bids made by Carmen. Since each of the 3 other people bid once, Carmens must make 3 bids in total. Thus, the total cost of the desk to Carmen is 200 + 50(3) = 200 + 150 = $350.","3 other people are bidding on the desk so there are 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 added to the cost of the desk by other people.

How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her?","Answer: Since the bids on the desk rise by $50 each time, Carmen's winning bid is $200 + (3 * $50) = $200 + $150 = $350.
Therefore, the desk costs Carmen $350.","3 other people are bidding on the desk so there are 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 added to the cost of the desk by other people.

The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time and 3 other people each bid once. Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people and eventually wins. How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her?","Let's break it down:

- The opening bid was $200.
- After each of the 3 other people bid, the price increases by $50. So, the desk's price after the first bid is $200 + $50 = $250.
- The price after the second bid is $250 + $50 = $300.
- And the price after the third bid is $300 + $50 = $350.

Therefore, Carmen wins the desk for $350.

So, the desk costs her $350.","3 other people are bidding on the desk so there are 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 added to the cost of the desk by other people.
Carmen also has to bid against each person, so she also adds 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 to the overall cost.
So in these bids, there has been a total of $150 + $150 = $<<150+150=300>>300 added to the initial cost of the desk.
The desk therefore costs $200 opening bid + $300 added cost = $<<200+300=500>>500.
