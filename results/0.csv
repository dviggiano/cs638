Math,1a,"A: If each class has 80 students total and 40% of the students are girls, then 60% of the students are boys.
So, in each class, there are 80 students x 60% = 48 boys.
Therefore, there are 48 boys in each class.","If both classes have the same amount of students, that means each of them has 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 students.
The girls in each class make up to 40%, so there are 40/100 * 40 = <<40/100*40=16>>16 girls in each of them.
That means the rest of the class are boys, so there are 40 - 16 = <<40-16=24>>24 boys in each class.

Math,1a,"A: If 40% of the students in each class are girls, then 60% are boys.
Since each class has the same number of students, then 60% of the students in each class are boys.
This means that 60% of the students in each class are boys, so there are 60/100 * 80 = <<60/100*80=48>>48 boys in each class.
So, there are 48 boys in each class.","If both classes have the same amount of students, that means each of them has 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 students.

Math,2,"A: If each class has the same amount of students, then each class has 80 students / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 students.
If 40% of the students in each class are girls, then 60% are boys.
Therefore, there are 40 students x 60% = <<40*60*.01=24>>24 boys in each class.","If both classes have the same amount of students, that means each of them has 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 students.
The girls in each class make up to 40%, so there are 40/100 * 40 = <<40/100*40=16>>16 girls in each of them.

Math,3a,"A: Since each class has the same number of students and 40% are girls, then 60% are boys in each class.
If the total number of students in both classes is 80, then each class has 80 / 2 = 40 students.
60% of 40 students is 0.60 * 40 = <<0.60*40=24>>24 boys in each class.
Therefore, each class has 24 boys.","If both classes have the same amount of students, that means each of them has 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 students.

Math,3b,"A: If each class has the same number of students and 40% of the students are girls, then 60% are boys.
So, in each class, 60% of the students are boys, which means there are 0.6 * 80 = 48 boys in each class. 
Therefore, there are 48 boys in each class.","If both classes have the same amount of students, that means each of them has 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 students.
