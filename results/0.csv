Math,1a,"Q: A family bought 1 box of pizza that is cut into 16 slices. Only three-fourths of the pizza was eaten by the family. How many slices of pizza were left?
A: The family ate 16 x 3/4 = <<16*3/4=12>>12 slices.
So, there were 16 - 12 = <<16-12=4>>4 slices of pizza left.

Q: Parker is 4 inches shorter than Daisy. Daisy is 8 inches taller than Reese. If Reese is 60 inches tall, what is the average height for the three of them?
A: Since Daisy is 6 inches taller than Reese, she must be 60 inches + 8 inches = 68 inches tall.
Parker is 4 inches shorter than Daisy, making her 68 inches – 4 inches = <<68-4=64>>64 inches.
The average height of the three of them is (60 inches + 68 inches + 64 inches) / 3 = <<(60+68+64)/3=64>>64 inches.

Q: 20 kids in preschool are ready for a nap.  1/2 of the kids fall asleep within the first 5 minutes.  Then half of the kids remaining fall asleep within another 5 minutes.  How many kids are still awake?
A: In a class with 20 kids, 1/2 of the students have already fallen asleep so 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 kids are already asleep
We start with 20 kids awake and 10 are already asleep so 20- 10 = <<20-10=10>>10 kids are still awake
1/2 of these 10 kids fall asleep next meaning there are 10/2 = <<10/2=5>>5 students still awake

Q: Jerry takes 2 antacids that weigh 2 grams each and are 5% zinc by weight. Then he takes three more smaller antacids that weigh 1 gram each and have 15% zinc. How many milligrams of zinc does he eat?
A: First find the total weight of the big antacids: 2 grams/antacid * 2 antacids = <<2*2=4>>4 grams
Then convert that weight to milligrams: 4 grams * 1000 mg/gram = <<4*1000=4000>>4000 mg
Then multiply that number by 5% to find how much zinc is in the big antacids: 4000 mg * 5% = <<4000*5*.01=200>>200 mg
Then find the total weight of the smaller antacids in milligrams: 3 antacids * 1 gram/antacid * 1000 mg/gram = <<3*1*1000=3000>>3000 mg
Then multiply that number by the percent of zinc to find the amount of zinc in the small antacids: 3000 mg * 15% = 450 mg
Then add the zinc Jerry gets from each set of pills to find the total amount of zinc he eats: 450 mg + 200 mg = <<450+200=650>>650 mg

Q: Jill can run up a hill at 9 feet/second and down a hill at 12 feet/second. How long does it take her to run up and down a 900 foot hill?
A: First find the time it takes Jill to run up the hill: 900 feet / 9 feet/second = <<900/9=100>>100 seconds
Then find the time it takes Jill to run down the hill: 900 feet / 12 feet/second = <<900/12=75>>75 seconds
Then add the two times to find Jill's total time: 100 seconds + 75 seconds = <<100+75=175>>175 seconds

Q: John ends up serving on jury duty.  Jury selection takes 2 days.  The trial itself lasts 4 times as long as jury selection  It is a complicated trial.  The number of hours spent in jury deliberation was the equivalent of 6 full days.  They spend 16 hours a day in deliberation.  How many days does John spend on jury duty?
A: Deliberation ended up taking 6 * 24 = <<6*24=144>>144 hours
That means they spent 144 / 16 = <<144/16=9>>9 days in deliberation
The trial lasted 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 days
So he spent 2 + 8 + 9 = <<2+8+9=19>>19 days on jury duty

Q: A salesman bought a case of 48 backpacks for $576. He sold 17 of them for $18 at the swap meet, 10 were sold to a department store for $25 each. If the remainder were sold for $22 each. How much was the salesman's profit?
A: The salesman sold 17 bags for 17 bags x $18/bag = $<<17*18=306>>306
He sold 10 more for 10 bags x $25/bag = $<<10*25=250>>250
Thus far he has sold 17 bags + 10 bags = <<17+10=27>>27 bags
Therefore he sold 48 bags - 27 bags = <<48-27=21>>21 bags for $22 each
21 bags were sold for 21 bags x $22/bag = $<<21*22=462>>462
In total the salesman made $306 + $250 + $462 = $<<306+250+462=1018>>1018
The salesman made $1018 - $576 = $<<1018-576=442>>442 in profit.

Q: James catches 3 kinds of fish.  He catches 200 pounds of trout,  50% more pounds of salmon, and twice as much Tuna.  How many pounds of fish did he catch?
A: He caught 200*.55=100 pounds more salmon than trout
So he caught 200+100=<<200+100=300>>300 pounds of salmon
He caught 300*2=<<300*2=600>>600 pounds of tuna
So in total, he caught 600+300+200=<<600+300+200=1100>>1100 pounds of fish

Q: Carla's sheepdog rounded up 90% of her sheep, but the remaining 10% wandered off into the hills. If there are 81 sheep in the pen, how many are out in the wilderness?
A: First find the total number of sheep by dividing the number rounded up by 90%: 81 sheep / .9 = <<81/.9=90>>90 sheep
Then multiply that number by 10% to find the number that are in the hills: 90 sheep * 10% = <<90*10*.01=9>>9 sheep

So he caught 200+100=<<200+100=300>>300 pounds of salmon
He caught 300*2=<<300*2=600>>600 pounds of tuna
So in total, he caught 600+300+200=<<600+300+200=1100>>1100 pounds of fish

Q: A salesman bought a case of 48 backpacks for $576. He sold 17 of them for $18 at the swap meet, 10 were sold to a department store for $25 each. If the remainder were sold for $22 each. How much was the salesman's profit?
A: The salesman sold 17 bags for 17 bags x $18/bag = $<<17*18=306>>306
He sold 10 more for 10 bags x $25/bag = $<<10*25=250>>250
Thus far he has sold 17 bags + 10 bags = <<17+10=27>>27 bags
Therefore he sold 48 bags - 27 bags = <<48-27=21>>21 bags for $22 each
21 bags were sold for 21 bags x $22/bag = $<<21*22=462>>462
In total the salesman made $306 + $250 + $462 = $<<306+250+462=1018>>1018
The salesman made $1018 - $576 = $<<1018-576=442>>442 in profit.
