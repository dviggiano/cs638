Q: The Kennel house keeps 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs. If a German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food and a bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day. How many kilograms of dog food will they need in a week?","A: The German Shepherds will need 3 German Shepherds * 5 kilograms * 7 days = <<3*5*7=105>>105 kilograms of dog food per week
The Bulldogs will need 2 Bulldogs * 3 kilograms * 7 days = <<2*3*7=42>>42 kilograms of dog food per week
So in total, they will need 105 kilograms + 42 kilograms = <<105+42=147>>147 kilograms of dog food in a week.","The German Shepherds consume 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 kilograms of dog food per day.
The Bulldogs consume 2 x 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 kilograms of dog food per day.
The dogs can consume a total of 15 + 6 = <<15+6=21>>21 kilograms of dog food per day.
Therefore, they need 21 x 7 = <<21*7=147>>147 kilograms of dog food in a week.
