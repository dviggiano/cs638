Math,0,"Question: On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. At the till she got $2 off because she had a voucher. The next day, the price shot to $30 per fruit, but the store also offered a 10% discount on the total cost. Sheila took advantage of the discount and bought 20 pomegranates. What is the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days?","The final price that Clara paid for the pomegranates on Tuesday can be calculated as follows:

20 pomegranates * $20 per pomegranate = $400

After the $2 voucher discount, Clara paid $400 - $2 = $398

The final price that Sheila paid for the pomegranates on Wednesday can be calculated as follows:

20 pomegranates * $30 per pomegranate = $600

With a 10% discount, Sheila paid $600 * 0.10 = $60 less

So, Sheila paid a total of $600 - $60 = $540

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:

$540 (Sheila) - $398 (Clara) = $142

Therefore, the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $142.","On Tuesday, the pomegranates cost Clara 20 pomegranates * $20/pomegranates = $<<20*20=400>>400
Using the voucher, she paid $400 - $2 = $<<400-2=398>>398
On Wednesday, the pomegranates cost Sheila 20 pomegranates * $30 = $<<20*30=600>>600.
She then got a discount of 10/100 * $600 = $<<10/100*600=60>>60
Sheila ended up paying $600 - $60 = $<<600-60=540>>540
The difference is therefore $540 - $398 = $<<540-398=142>>142
