Math,1a,"Question: Alice and Bob decided to bake cookies for their first date. Alice baked 74 chocolate chip cookies and Bob baked 7 peanut butter cookies. After accidentally throwing some on the floor, Alice baked 5 more cookies and Bob baked 36 more. If they had 93 edible cookies at the end, how many were accidentally thrown on the floor?
Answer: Before throwing the cookies, Alice and Bob baked 74 + 7 = <<74+7=81>>81 cookies.
After throwing the cookies, they baked 5 + 36 = <<5+36=41>>41 cookies.
In total, they baked 81 + 41 = <<81+41=122>>122 cookies
They threw 122 - 93 = <<122-93=29>>29 cookies on the floor.

Question: A retailer sells any shirt for the same price and any pair of pants for the same price, but the price of shirts and pants are not the same. Say you bought 2 shirts and 3 pairs of pants for $120 in total, then you realized you didn't need the extra pants. What's the price of 1 shirt at this place if when you returned all 3 pairs of pants you were refunded 25% of what you originally paid?
Answer: If I paid $120 and I was refunded 25% for all the 3 pants, then that means I received 25%*120=$<<120*25*.01=30>>30
This means the total price of the 2 shirts was 120-30 = <<120-30=90>>90
The price of one shirt is thus 90/2 = <<90/2=45>>45

Question: Ronnie was given $5 while Rissa was given thrice as much. After each of them had given an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. How much is left in Ronnie's money?","Answer: Since Rissa was given thrice as much money as Ronnie, she received 3 * $5 = $15.
After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 1 - 1/5 = 4/5 of her money, which is $15 * 4/5 = $12.
This means Rissa gave away $15 - $12 = $3 to her little sister.
Since Ronnie gave an equal amount, Ronnie also gave $3 to their little sister.
Therefore, Ronnie is left with $5 - $3 = $2.
#### $2","Rissa was given $5 x 3 = $<<5*3=15>>15.
After Rissa had given an amount to her sister, she has $15 x 4/5 = $<<15*4/5=12>>12 left.
This means she has given $15 - $12 = $<<15-12=3>>3.
Since Ronnie had given the same amount as Rissa, then Ronnie is left with $5 - $3 = $<<5-3=2>>2.

Math,1a,"Question: Jenny is planning her catering budget for her wedding. She's going to have 80 guests. 3 times as many guests want steak as chicken. If each steak entree costs $25 and each chicken entree costs $18, how much is the total catering budget?
Answer: Let s be the number of guests who want steak and c be the number who want chicken. We know that s + c = 80 and s = 3c.
Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get 3c + c = 80
Combining like terms, we get 4c = 80
Dividing both sides by 4, we get c = 20
Then multiply the number of guests who want chicken by the cost of each chicken entree: 20 guests * $18/guest = $<<20*18=360>>360
Then triple the number of guests who want chicken to find the number who want steak: 20 guests * 3 = <<20*3=60>>60 guests
Then multiply the number of guests who want steak by the cost of each steak entree: 60 guests * $25/guest = $<<60*25=1500>>1500
Then add the cost of the steak and chicken entrees to find the total cost: $1500 + $360 = $<<1500+360=1860>>1860

Question: Skyler is a composer. He wrote 25 hit songs that made it on the top 10 charts; ten more songs that made it on the top 100 charts than the hit songs; 5 fewer songs than the hit songs that were never released. How many songs did Skyler write in all?
Answer: Skyler wrote 25 + 10 = <<25+10=35>>35 songs that made it on the top 100.
He wrote 25 - 5 = <<25-5=20>>20 songs that were never released.
So, Skyler wrote a total of 25 + 35 + 20 = <<25+35+20=80>>80 songs.

Question: Ronnie was given $5 while Rissa was given thrice as much. After each of them had given an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. How much is left in Ronnie's money?","Let x be the amount of money given to Rissa. Therefore, 3x is the amount of money given to Ronnie.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. This means she has 1 - 1/5 = 4/5 of her money left. So, Rissa has 4/5*x = 4/5x left.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Ronnie is left with 3/4 of his money. This means he has 1 - 1/4 = 3/4 of his money left. So, Ronnie has 3/4*3x = 9/4x = 2.25x left.

We know that x + 3x = 5, because Ronnie was given $5 while Rissa was given thrice as much. This simplifies to 4x = 5, so x = 5/4 = $1.25.

Therefore, Ronnie has 2.25*1.25 = $<<2.25*1.25=2.8125>>2.81 left in his money.","Rissa was given $5 x 3 = $<<5*3=15>>15.
After Rissa had given an amount to her sister, she has $15 x 4/5 = $<<15*4/5=12>>12 left.
This means she has given $15 - $12 = $<<15-12=3>>3.
Since Ronnie had given the same amount as Rissa, then Ronnie is left with $5 - $3 = $<<5-3=2>>2.

Question: Ronnie was given $5 while Rissa was given thrice as much. After each of them had given an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. How much is left in Ronnie's money?","Answer: If Rissa was given three times as much money as Ronnie, she received 3 * $5 = $15.
Let x be the amount each of them gave to their little sister.
After giving x amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with (15 - x) = (4/5)*15.
Multiplying both sides by 5 to remove the fraction, we get 5*(15 - x) = 4*15.
Expanding the left side gives 75 - 5x = 60.
Adding 5x to both sides gives 75 = 5x + 60.
Subtracting 60 from both sides gives 15 = 5x.
Dividing by 5, we get x = 3, which means each of them gave their sister $3.
Since Ronnie was given $5 and gave $3 to their sister, he has $5 - $3 = $2 left.","Rissa was given $5 x 3 = $<<5*3=15>>15.
