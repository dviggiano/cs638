Math,0,"Question: Jim is making a comforter for his king-sized bed. He needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, which measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. How many square feet of fabric does Jim need to buy?","To find the total square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the two pieces of fabric.

For a king-sized bed that is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide, Jim needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider. 

The dimensions of the two pieces of fabric will be:
Length: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
Width: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now we can calculate the total square feet of fabric needed by multiplying the length and width of one piece of fabric, and then multiplying that by 2 (since Jim needs two pieces of fabric):

Total square feet = (8 feet x 10 feet) x 2 pieces = 160 square feet

Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric to make a comforter for his king-sized bed.","First find the length of each piece of fabric by adding 2 feet to the bed's length: 6 feet + 2 feet = <<6+2=8>>8 feet
Then find the width of each piece of fabric by adding 2 feet to the bed's width: 8 feet + 2 feet = <<8+2=10>>10 feet
Then find the square footage of each piece of fabric by multiplying its length and width: 8 feet * 10 feet = <<8*10=80>>80 square feet
Then double that amount since Jim needs two pieces of fabric: 80 square feet/piece * 2 pieces = <<80*2=160>>160 square feet

Math,1a,"Question: Tom's puts 30 miles per day on his bike for the first 183 days of the year.  For the rest of the days of the year he goes 35 miles per day.  How many miles does he drive for the year?
Answer: For the first 183 days he drives 183*30=<<183*30=5490>>5490 miles
There are 365-183=<<365-183=182>>182 days left in the year
He drives 35*182=<<35*182=6370>>6370 for those days

Question: Tom invites his parents and 3 siblings to his house.  They each eat 3 times a day.  How many plates do Tom and his guests use while they are there for the 4 days if each person uses 2 plates per meal?
Answer: There were 1+2+3=<<1+2+3=6>>6 people at the house
That means they use 6*2=<<6*2=12>>12 plates per meal
So they use 12*3=<<12*3=36>>36 plates per day
That means they use 36*4=<<36*4=144>>144 plates for the visit

Question: Jim is making a comforter for his king-sized bed. He needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, which measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. How many square feet of fabric does Jim need to buy?","Answer: The king-sized bed is 6 feet long by 8 feet wide, so it has an area of 6 * 8 = <<6*8=48>>48 square feet.
Jim needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, so each piece of fabric will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.
The area of each piece of fabric is 8 * 10 = <<8*10=80>>80 square feet.
Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, he will need a total of 80 * 2 = <<80*2=160>>160 square feet of fabric. 
Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.","First find the length of each piece of fabric by adding 2 feet to the bed's length: 6 feet + 2 feet = <<6+2=8>>8 feet
