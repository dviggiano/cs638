Math,0,"Question: Peter has $70 and wishes to spend an equal amount each day for one week. From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. For the rest of the week, he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. How many total action figures will he have by the end of the week?","From Sunday through Wednesday, Peter spent a total of $5 * 4 days = $20 on wooden action figures.
He had $70 - $20 = $50 left for the rest of the week.
He can spend $50 / 2 = 25 on plastic action figures on Thursday and Friday.
So, he can buy 25 / 2 = 12.5 plastic action figures, which means he will buy 12 plastic action figures.
By the end of the week, Peter will have a total of 4 + 12 = 16 action figures.","There are 7 days in a week so if he wishes to spend an equal amount of $70 each day that would be $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10
For four days (Sunday through Wednesday) he will spend 4*$10 = $<<4*10=40>>40
He will spend $40 on wooden action figures of $5 each which gives $40/$5 = <<40/5=8>>8 wooden action figures
For the remaining 3 days he will spend 3*$10 = $<<3*10=30>>30
He will spend $30 on plastic action figures of $2 each which gives $30/$2 = <<30/2=15>>15 plastic action figures
Altogether, he will have 8+15 = <<8+15=23>>23 action figures.

Math,1a,"Question: In a factory, there are 3 machines working 23 hours a day. The owner decided to buy a fourth machine, which works only 12 hours a day. One machine can produce 2 kg of material every hour. The factory sells the produced material for $50 per 1 kg. How much can this factory earn in one day?
Answer: The total runtime for the first three machines is 3 machines * 23 hours/day/machine = <<3*23=69>>69 hours/day.
So these machines could produce 69 hours/day * 2 kg/hour = <<69*2=138>>138 kg/day.
The fourth machine could produce 12 hours/day * 2 kg/hour = <<12*2=24>>24 kg/day of material.
In total all the machines would produce 138 kg/day + 24 kg/day = <<138+24=162>>162 kg/day of material.
The factory would therefore earn 162 kg/day * $50/kg = $<<162*50=8100>>8100/day.

Question: Bob can shuck 10 oysters in 5 minutes.  How many oysters can he shuck in 2 hours?
Answer: He shucks 10 oysters in 5 minutes we need to know how many 5 minute units are in 60 minutes so 60/5 = 12 units
He can shuck 10 oysters in 5 minutes and there are 12 5 minute units in an hour so he can shuck 10*12 = <<10*12=120>>120 oysters in 1 hour
If he can shuck 120 oysters in 1 hour, so for 2 hours in can shuck 2*120 = 240 oysters

He had $70 - $20 = $50 left to spend on plastic action figures.
Each plastic action figure costs $2, so he can buy $50 / $2 per figure = 25 plastic action figures.
In total, Peter will have bought 4 days * 5 figures/day = 20 wooden action figures and 3 days * 25 figures/day = 75 plastic action figures.
Therefore, he will have a total of 20 + 75 = 95 action figures.","There are 7 days in a week so if he wishes to spend an equal amount of $70 each day that would be $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10

He has $70 - $20 = $<<70-20=50>>50 left for the plastic action figures.
He can buy $50 / $2 = <<50/2=25>>25 plastic action figures.
