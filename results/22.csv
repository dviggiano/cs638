Math,0,"Question: James gets a job selling used cars.  He sold 10 cars that cost $25,000 each.  The company paid 30% of that price to acquire the cars.  He got a 10% commission on the profits.  How much did he make?","First, we need to calculate the total cost of the cars sold: 
10 cars * $25,000 per car = $250,000

Next, we need to determine how much the company paid to acquire the cars:
30% of $250,000 = 0.30 * $250,000 = $75,000

Now, we need to calculate the total profit made on the sales:
Total sales - Cost to acquire cars = Total profit
$250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

James received a 10% commission on the profits. We can calculate his commission as:
10% of $175,000 = 0.10 * $175,000 = $17,500

Therefore, James made $17,500 in commission from selling 10 cars.","He sold the car for 25000*10=$<<25000*10=250000>>250,000
Each car was bought for 25,000*.3=$<<25000*.3=7500>>7500
So they bought the cars for 7500*10=$<<7500*10=75000>>75,000
That means the cars had a profit of 250,000-75,000=$<<250000-75000=175000>>175,000
So his commission was 175,000*.1=$<<175000*.1=17500>>17,500

Of the students that play the saxophone, a third of them play the alto saxophone. How many students play the alto saxophone?
Answer: The number of students in the marching band is 600 / 5 = <<600/5=120>>120 students
The number of students that play a brass instrument is 120 / 2 = <<120/2=60>>60 students

Question: Jenny and Mark are throwing bottle caps. Jenny's bottlecap flies 18 feet straight, then bounces off a street light and flies another 1/3 of the distance it already went. Mark's bottle cap flies 15 feet forward, then bounces off a window and flies twice as far as it already did. How much further did Mark's bottle cap go than Jenny's?
Answer: First find 1/3 of the distance Jenny's bottlecap went straight: 18 feet / 3 = <<18/3=6>>6 feet
Then add that to the distance it flew straight to find the total distance it traveled: 6 feet + 18 feet = <<6+18=24>>24 feet
Then find twice the distance Mark's bottlecap went straight: 15 feet * 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 feet
Then add that distance to the distance it flew straight to find the total distance it traveled: 30 feet + 15 feet = <<30+15=45>>45 feet
Then subtract the distance Jenny's bottlecap traveled from the distance Mark's traveled to find the difference: 45 feet - 24 feet = <<45-24=21>>21 feet

Question: James gets a job selling used cars.  He sold 10 cars that cost $25,000 each.  The company paid 30% of that price to acquire the cars.  He got a 10% commission on the profits.  How much did he make?","First, find how much the company paid for each car by multiplying the cost by the percentage they paid: $25,000 * 30% = $7500
Then subtract that amount from the original price to find how much profit there was on each car: $25,000 - $7500 = $17,500
Multiply that amount by the number of cars sold to find the total profit: $17,500 * 10 = $175,000
Multiply the total profit by James's commission percentage to find how much he made: $175,000 * 10% = $17,500
Add that amount to his base salary to find his total earnings: $17,500 + $30,000 = $47,500. Answer: $47,500","He sold the car for 25000*10=$<<25000*10=250000>>250,000
Each car was bought for 25,000*.3=$<<25000*.3=7500>>7500
So they bought the cars for 7500*10=$<<7500*10=75000>>75,000
That means the cars had a profit of 250,000-75,000=$<<250000-75000=175000>>175,000
So his commission was 175,000*.1=$<<175000*.1=17500>>17,500

Answer: Aang, Sokka and Toph caught 7 fish + 5 fish + 12 fish = <<7+5+12=24>>24 fish.

Question: James gets a job selling used cars.  He sold 10 cars that cost $25,000 each.  The company paid 30% of that price to acquire the cars.  He got a 10% commission on the profits.  How much did he make?","First, let's calculate the total amount the company paid to acquire the cars. Since the cars cost $25,000 each and James sold 10 cars, the total cost is 10 cars * $25,000/car = $250,000.

Next, let's find out how much the company paid to acquire the cars, which is 30% of $250,000. This can be calculated as $250,000 * 30% = $250,000 * 0.30 = $75,000.

Now, let's find out the total profit made from selling the cars. The profit made by selling the cars is the total cost of the cars ($250,000) minus what the company paid to acquire the cars ($75,000), which is $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

Lastly, let's calculate James's commission on the profits. James received a 10% commission on the profits, so his commission is 10% of $175,000, which is $175,000 * 10% = $175,000 * 0.10 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500 selling used cars.","He sold the car for 25000*10=$<<25000*10=250000>>250,000
Each car was bought for 25,000*.3=$<<25000*.3=7500>>7500
So they bought the cars for 7500*10=$<<7500*10=75000>>75,000
That means the cars had a profit of 250,000-75,000=$<<250000-75000=175000>>175,000
So his commission was 175,000*.1=$<<175000*.1=17500>>17,500

Question: James gets a job selling used cars.  He sold 10 cars that cost $25,000 each.  The company paid 30% of that price to acquire the cars.  He got a 10% commission on the profits.  How much did he make?","First, we need to calculate how much the company paid to acquire the cars. Since each car cost $25,000 and the company paid 30% of that price, the company paid 0.30 * $25,000 = $7,500 for each car.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total cost for the company to acquire those cars was $7,500 * 10 = $75,000.

Now, we need to determine the total revenue from selling the cars. Since James sold each car for $25,000, the total revenue from selling 10 cars is $25,000 * 10 = $250,000.

The profit from selling the cars is the revenue minus the cost, so the profit is $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

Finally, James receives a 10% commission on the profits, so he made $175,000 * 0.10 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500 selling 10 cars.","He sold the car for 25000*10=$<<25000*10=250000>>250,000
Each car was bought for 25,000*.3=$<<25000*.3=7500>>7500
So they bought the cars for 7500*10=$<<7500*10=75000>>75,000
That means the cars had a profit of 250,000-75,000=$<<250000-75000=175000>>175,000
So his commission was 175,000*.1=$<<175000*.1=17500>>17,500
