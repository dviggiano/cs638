Question: A tailor purchased buttons for the clothes. She bought 90 green buttons, 10 more yellow buttons than the green buttons, and 5 fewer blue buttons than the green buttons. How many buttons did the tailor purchase?
Answer: The tailor bought 90 + 10 = <<90+10=100>>100 yellow buttons.
He also bought 90 - 5 = <<90-5=85>>85 blue buttons.
Therefore, The tailor purchased 90 + 100 + 85 = <<90+100+85=275>>275 buttons.

Q: Mark was unwell for 3 months, during which he lost 10 pounds per month. If his final weight was 70 pounds, what was his initial weight?","Let x be Mark's initial weight.
Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so he lost a total of 10*3 = 30 pounds.
If his final weight was 70 pounds, then his initial weight x minus the 30 pounds lost equals 70 pounds.
Therefore, the equation is x - 30 = 70.
Adding 30 to both sides, we get x = 70 + 30 = 100.
Therefore, Mark's initial weight was <<100>>100 pounds.","Since Mark was losing 10 pounds each month, in 3 months he lost 10 * 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 pounds.
Adding the weight lost to the final weight gives an initial weight of 70 + 30 = <<70+30=100>>100 pounds.
Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds.

Question: A car is driving through a tunnel with many turns. After a while, the car must travel through a ring that requires a total of 4 right-hand turns. After the 1st turn, it travels 5 meters. After the 2nd turn, it travels 8 meters. After the 3rd turn, it travels a little further and at the 4th turn, it immediately exits the tunnel.
