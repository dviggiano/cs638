Math,0,"Question: Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. If Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, how big is Timothy's locker in cubic inches?","Let's first find the size of Zack's locker:

Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, so Zack's locker is 4 times bigger than Peter's locker.

If Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, then Zack's locker is 4 * 5 = 20 cubic inches.

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, Timothy's locker is 2 * 20 = 40 cubic inches. 

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches in size.","Zack's locker is 5*4=<<5*4=20>>20 cubic inches.
Timothy's locker is 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 cubic inches.

Math,1a,"Question: One white rhino weighs 5100 pounds and one black rhino weighs 1 ton. How many pounds would 7 white rhinos and 8 black rhinos weigh in total?
Answer: 5100 * 7 = <<5100*7=35700>>35,700 pounds
1 ton = <<2000=2000>>2000 pounds
8 * 2000 = <<8*2000=16000>>16000 pounds

Math,1b,"Question: Jenny wants to sell some girl scout cookies and has the choice of two neighborhoods to visit.  Neighborhood A has 10 homes which each will buy 2 boxes of cookies.  Neighborhood B has 5 homes, each of which will buy 5 boxes of cookies.  Assuming each box of cookies costs $2, how much will Jenny make at the better choice of the two neighborhoods?
Answer: First, we need to determine which neighborhood is the better choice by comparing the number of boxes sold. A has 10 houses which will buy 2 boxes each, meaning A will give Jenny 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 box sales
Neighborhood B has 5 homes which will each buy 5 boxes, meaning she will sell 5*5=<<5*5=25>>25 boxes by going to that neighborhood.
Since 25>20, this means Jenny should choose neighborhood B.
Since Jenny earns $2 per box sold, this means she will earn 25*2=<<25*2=50>>50 dollars by choosing neighborhood B.

Question: Grady has 20 red numbered cubes and 15 blue numbered cubes. He gives his friend Gage 2/5 of his red numbered cubes and 1/3 of the blue numbered cubes. If Gage had 10 red numbered cubes and 12 blue numbered cubes, find the total number of cubes Gage has?
Answer: Grady gave 2/5 * 20 cubes = <<2/5*20=8>>8 of his red numbered cubes to Gage.
If Gage initially had 10 red numbered cubes, his total number of red numbered cubes became 10 cubes + 8 cubes = <<10+8=18>>18 cubes after Grady gave him 8 more.
Grady also gave 1/3 * 15 cubes = <<1/3*15=5>>5 blue numbered cubes to Gage.
This increased Gage's total number of blue numbered cubes to 12 cubes + 5 cubes = <<12+5=17>>17 cubes

So, Zack's locker is 4 * 5 = <<4*5=20>>20 cubic inches.
Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, Timothy's locker is 2 * 20 = <<2*20=40>>40 cubic inches.
