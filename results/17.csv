Math,1a,"Question: Merry had 50 boxes of apples on Saturday and 25 boxes on Sunday. There were 10 apples in each box. If she sold a total of 720 apples on Saturday and Sunday, how many boxes of apples are left?
Answer: Merry had a total of 50 + 25 = <<50+25=75>>75 boxes of apples.
These 75 boxes is equal to 75 x 10 = <<75*10=750>>750 apples.
There were 750 - 720 = <<750-720=30>>30 apples left.
Thus, 30/10 = <<30/10=3>>3 boxes of apples are left.

Q: A bumper car rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than they have red cars. They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars. The rink also has yellow cars.  If the rink has 75 cars in total how many yellow cars do they have?","A: The rink has 12 red cars, 2 fewer green cars than red cars (12 - 2 = 10 green cars), and 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars (10 x 3 = 30 blue cars). 

Adding the red, green, blue cars gives a total of 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 cars.

If there are 75 cars in total, then there are 75 - 52 = 23 yellow cars. 

Therefore, there are 23 yellow cars in the bumper car rink.","The rink has 12-2= <<12-2=10>>10 green cars.

Answer: For the first week, they bought 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15kgs.
For the next week, they bought twice the quantity of oranges which is 2*15 = <<2*15=30>>30kgs.

Question: Niko has bought 9 pairs of socks that cost $2 each and plans to resell them. He wants to gain 25% profit from four of the pairs of socks and $0.2 profit each for the other 5 pairs of socks. How much will his total profit be?
Answer: Niko will earn $2 x 25/100 = $<<2*25/100=0.5>>0.5 profit for each of the first four pairs of socks.
So, his total profit for the four pairs of socks will be $0.5 x 4 = $<<0.5*4=2>>2.
His total earnings for the 5 pairs of socks is $0.2 x 5 = $<<0.2*5=1>>1.

Q: A bumper car rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than they have red cars. They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars. The rink also has yellow cars.  If the rink has 75 cars in total how many yellow cars do they have?","Let's denote the number of green cars as G and the number of blue cars as B.

We know that G = 12 - 2 = 10 (since they have 2 fewer green cars than red cars).

We also know that B = 3G = 3 * 10 = 30.

The total number of cars in the rink is R + G + B + Y = 12 + 10 + 30 + Y = 75.

Solving the equation, we get Y = 75 - 52 = 23.

Therefore, the rink has 23 yellow cars.","The rink has 12-2= <<12-2=10>>10 green cars.
The rink has 10*3= <<10*3=30>>30 blue cars.
The rink has 12+10+30= <<12+10+30=52>>52 cars that are not yellow.
The rink has 75-52= <<75-52=23>>23 yellow cars.

Q: A bumper car rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than they have red cars. They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars. The rink also has yellow cars.  If the rink has 75 cars in total how many yellow cars do they have?","Let x be the number of green cars.
The total number of cars is 12 red + x green + 3x blue + yellow = 75.
Substitute the values:
12 + x + 3x + yellow = 75
Combine like terms:
4x + yellow = 63
Since they have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, x = 12 - 2 = 10.
Substitute x back into the equation:
4(10) + yellow = 63
40 + yellow = 63
Subtract 40 from both sides:
yellow = 63 - 40
yellow = 23
Therefore, the bumper car rink has 23 yellow cars.","The rink has 12-2= <<12-2=10>>10 green cars.
The rink has 10*3= <<10*3=30>>30 blue cars.
The rink has 12+10+30= <<12+10+30=52>>52 cars that are not yellow.
