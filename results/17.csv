Question: James won a money prize at a charity raffle. He donated half of his winnings back to the charity, then spent $2 on a hot dog to celebrate his win. He had $55 left over. How many dollars did he win?
Answer: Let W be equal to James’s raffle winnings.
He donated half his winnings, so he had W - W/2 = W/2 left.
He then spent $2 on a hot dog, so W/2 - 2 = $55.
Thus, half his winnings is W/2 = 55 + 2 = <<55+2=57>>57.
James won W = 57 * 2 = $<<57*2=114>>114.
