Math,1a,"Question: Jim decides he wants to practice for a marathon coming up.  He starts off by running 5 miles every day for 30 days straight.  He then pushes himself to run 10 miles a day for the next 30 days.  Finally, as marathon day gets closer Jim runs 20 miles a day for 30 days straight.  How many miles does Jim run in total during the 90 days?
Answer: Jim runs 5 miles a day for 30 days for a total of 5*30=<<5*30=150>>150 miles.
The next month Jim runs 10 miles a day for 10*30= <<10*30=300>>300 miles.
The last month Jim runs 20 miles a day for 20*30=<<20*30=600>>600 a month.
All together, Jim runs 150+300+600= <<150+300+600=1050>>1050 miles in three months.

Question: Chloe and Max played Mario Kart together. The ratio of Chloe’s wins to Max’s wins is 8:3. Chloe won 24 times. How many times did Max win?
Answer: We are trying to figure out how many times Max won at Mario Kart, so we'll call that number Y.
We know the ratio of Chloe’s wins to Max’s wins is 8/3, so 8/3 = 24/Y.
Next, we will multiply to find the cross-products. 8 x Y = 3 x 24 or 8Y = 72.
We want to get figure out Y, so we need to get it by itself by dividing by 8, like this: 8Y / 8 = 72 / 8.
Y = <<9=9>>9, so Max won 9 times.

Question: Tyler wants to buy a dictionary that costs $18, a dinosaur book that costs $13, and a children's cookbook that costs $8. He has saved $14 from his allowance. If Tyler earns $5 per hour, how many hours does he have to work to afford his books?","First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy. 

Total cost = $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39

Next, let's subtract the $14 Tyler has already saved from his total cost to find out how much more money he needs to earn.

Amount still needed = $39 (total cost) - $14 (saved) = $25

Now, we need to figure out how many hours Tyler needs to work to earn $25 at a rate of $5 per hour.

Hours needed to work = $25 (amount needed) ÷ $5 (earnings per hour) = 5 hours

Tyler needs to work for 5 hours to afford the books he wants to buy.
So, Tyler needs to work for **5 hours**.","Tyler wants to purchase books that cost $18 + $13 + $8 = $<<18+13+8=39>>39.
Tyler needs $39 and currently has $14, so he needs to earn $39 - $14 = $<<39-14=25>>25.
Tyler can earn $25 at a rate of $5 per hour by doing 25 / $5 = <<25/5=5>>5 hours of work.

Math,1a,"Question: Carly is making a beaded corset. She's going to add 50 rows of purple beads with 20 beads per row, 40 rows of blue beads with 18 beads per row, and 80 gold beads. If beads cost $1 per 10 beads, how much do all the beads she bought cost?
Answer: First find the total number of purple beads Carly needs: 50 rows * 20 beads/row = <<50*20=1000>>1000 beads
Then find the total number of blue beads Carly needs: 40 rows * 18 beads/row = <<40*18=720>>720 beads
Then add the number of each color she needs to find the total number she needs: 1000 beads + 720 beads + 80 beads = <<1000+720+80=1800>>1800 beads

If Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can now divide the amount he still needs to earn by his hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work. Therefore, $25 / $5 = <<25/5=5>>5 hours.
