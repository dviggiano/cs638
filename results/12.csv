Q: Miss Albert's class is composed of 12 boys and 12 girls. One-third of the girls and one-fourth of the boys are on varsity. How many students are not on varsity?","A: One-third of the girls is 12 / 3 = <<12/3=4>>4 girls.
One-fourth of the boys is 12 / 4 = <<12/4=3>>3 boys.
So, there are 12 - 4 = <<12-4=8>>8 girls not on varsity.
And there are 12 - 3 = <<12-3=9>>9 boys not on varsity.
Therefore, there are 8 + 9 = <<8+9=17>>17 students in total who are not on varsity.","There are 12 + 12 = <<12+12=24>>24 students in Miss Albert's class.
12 x 1/3 = <<12*1/3=4>>4 girls are on varsity.
12 x 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 boys are on varsity.
A total of 4 + 3 = <<4+3=7>>7 students in Miss Albert's class are on varsity.
Therefore, 24 - 7 = <<24-7=17>>17 students are not on varsity.

Math,1a,"Question: Edith is a receptionist at a local office and is organizing files into cabinets. She had 60 files and finished organizing half of them this morning. She has another 15 files to organize in the afternoon and the rest of the files are missing. How many files are missing?
Answer: Edith has already organized 60 files / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 files in the morning.
She has files left to organize so she must still have 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 files in the office.
This means there are 60 total files – 45 organized files = <<60-45=15>>15 missing files.

Question: Tim decides to run a campaign for governor.  He gets the maximum $1200 donation from 500 people, and three times as many people donated half this sum of money to his campaign.  These donations together accounted for 40% of the total money that Tim raised.  How much total money did he raise?
Answer: He got 1200*500=$<<1200*500=600000>>600,000 from maxed donors
The smaller donors donated 1200/2=$<<1200/2=600>>600
He had 500*3=<<500*3=1500>>1500 of these donors
So they donated 1500*600=$<<1500*600=900000>>900,000
So large donations where worth 900,000+600,000=$<<900000+600000=1500000>>1,500,000
So he raised 1,500,000/.4=$<<1500000/.4=3750000>>3750000

Q: Miss Albert's class is composed of 12 boys and 12 girls. One-third of the girls and one-fourth of the boys are on varsity. How many students are not on varsity?","A: One-third of the girls in the class is 12 * (1/3) = <<12*(1/3)=4>>4 girls on varsity.
One-fourth of the boys in the class is 12 * (1/4) = <<12*(1/4)=3>>3 boys on varsity.
So, the total number of students on varsity is 4 + 3 = <<4+3=7>>7 students.
Since there are 12 girls + 12 boys = <<12+12=24>>24 students in the class in total, the number of students not on varsity is 24 - 7 = <<24-7=17>>17 students.","There are 12 + 12 = <<12+12=24>>24 students in Miss Albert's class.
12 x 1/3 = <<12*1/3=4>>4 girls are on varsity.
