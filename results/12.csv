Math,0,"Question: Mary is an avid gardener. Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Mary remain with?","Mary will remain with 62 potted plants. 

She started with 40 window ledges x 2 potted plants = 80 potted plants.
She received 18 new potted plants, so she now has a total of 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants.
She plans to give away 1 potted plant from each ledge, so she will give away 40 plants.
Therefore, Mary will remain with 98 - 40 = 58 potted plants after giving away some to friends and family.","Yesterday, before receiving the plants, Mary had 2*40 = <<2*40=80>>80 potted plants
After receiving an additional 18 plants, she therefore had a total of 80 + 18 = <<80+18=98>>98 potted plants
Tomorrow, Mary’s plant giveaway will be 40 *1 = <<40*1=40>>40 potted plants.
She will therefore remain with 98 - 40 = <<98-40=58>>58 potted plants.

Question: Mary is an avid gardener. Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Mary remain with?","Answer: Mary has a total of 40 window ledges * 2 potted plants on each ledge = <<40*2=80>>80 potted plants.
If she gives away 1 potted plant from each ledge, she will give away a total of 40 window ledges * 1 potted plant = <<40*1=40>>40 potted plants.
Therefore, Mary will remain with 80 initial potted plants - 40 potted plants given away + 18 new potted plants = <<80-40+18=58>>58 potted plants. 
So, Mary will remain with 58 potted plants in total.","Yesterday, before receiving the plants, Mary had 2*40 = <<2*40=80>>80 potted plants
