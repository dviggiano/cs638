Math,0,Question: Grayson recycles cans and bottles for money each week. An aluminum can is worth two cents and a plastic bottle is worth three cents. She drinks three aluminum cans of soda and five plastic bottles of water a week. How many cents does Grayson earn from recycling in a four-week month?,"Grayson earns:
3 aluminum cans * 2 cents per can = 6 cents from aluminum cans per week
5 plastic bottles * 3 cents per bottle = 15 cents from plastic bottles per week
Total earnings per week = 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents
Total earnings in a four-week month = 21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents

Therefore, Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month.","Grayson earns 2 * 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 cents from soda cans a week.
She earns 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 cents from water bottles a week.
Thus, she earns 6 + 15 = <<6+15=21>>21 cents from recycling each week.
In a four week month, she earns 21 * 4 = <<21*4=84>>84 cents from recycling.

Math,1a,"Question: Arven bought five puppies for a total cost of $800. Three puppies are on sale for $150 each. How much does each of those two other puppies cost if they cost the same?
Answer: Three puppies on sale cost $150 x 3 = $<<150*3=450>>450.
The other two puppies cost $800 - $450 = $<<800-450=350>>350.
So, each of those two other puppies cost $350/2 = $<<350/2=175>>175.

Question: Francine wants to know if a local chemical plant is releasing toxic waste that makes the frogs mutate. In one local pond, she catches 5 frogs with extra legs, 2 frogs with 2 heads, two frogs that are bright red, and 18 normal frogs. What percentage of the frogs have mutated, rounded to the nearest integer?
Answer: First add up the numbers of the three kinds of mutant frog: 5 frogs + 2 frogs + 2 frogs = <<5+2+2=9>>9 frogs
Then add that number to the number of normal frogs to find the total number of frogs: 9 frogs + 18 frogs = <<9+18=27>>27 frogs
Finally, divide the number of mutant frogs by the total number of frogs and multiply by 100% to find the percentage of frogs that are mutants: 9 frogs / 27 frogs * 100% = 33.333...%, which rounds to 33%
