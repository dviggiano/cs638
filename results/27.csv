Math,1a,"Question: Janet is getting paid to moderate social media posts. She gets paid 25 cents per post she checks. If it takes her 10 seconds to check a post, how much does she earn per hour?
Answer: First find the number of seconds in an hour: 1 hour * 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute = <<1*60*60=3600>>3600 seconds/hour.
Then divide the total number of seconds per hour by the number of seconds it takes Janet to read one post: 3600 seconds/hour / 10 seconds/post = <<3600/10=360>>360 posts/hour.
Then multiply the number of posts she checks per hour by her pay per post to find her hourly pay: $0.25/post * 360 posts/hour = $<<0.25*360=90>>90/hour.

Question: Dustin and Sam are both reading. Dustin can read 75 pages in an hour. Sam can read 24 pages in an hour. How many more pages does Dustin read in 40 minutes compared to Sam?
Answer: Dustin reads 1.25 pages a minute because 75 / 60 = <<75/60=1.25>>1.25
Dustin reads 50 pages in 40 minutes because 40 x 1.25 = <<40*1.25=50>>50
Sam reads .4 pages a minute because 24 / 60 = <<24/60=.4>>.4
Sam reads 16 pages in 40 minutes because 40 x .4 = <<40*.4=16>>16
Dustin reads 34 more pages than Sam because 50 - 16 = <<34=34>>34

Q: Nate is feeding his livestock hay. Each goat needs 5 pounds, and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. If there are 15 goats and 12 sheep, how many pounds of hay does Nate need?","First, calculate how much hay each sheep needs. Twice the amount each goat needs is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds.
Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, each sheep needs 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.
Calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep by multiplying the amount each sheep needs by the number of sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds.
Calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats by multiplying the amount each goat needs by the number of goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds.
Add the amount of hay needed for the goats and the amount needed for the sheep to find the total amount of hay needed: 84 pounds + 75 pounds = 159 pounds. 
Nate needs 159 pounds of hay in total.","First figure out how much hay each sheep needs: 5 pounds * 2 - 3 = <<5*2-3=7>>7 pounds/sheep
Now figure out how much hay total the sheep need: 7 pounds/sheep * 12 sheep = <<7*12=84>>84 pounds
Now figure out how much hay total the goats need: 5 pounds/goat * 15 goats = <<5*15=75>>75 pounds
Now add the two amounts of hay to find the total: 84 pounds + 75 pounds = <<84+75=159>>159 pounds

Math,1a,"Question: Juanita enters a drumming contest. It costs $10 to enter. She has 2 minutes to hit as many drums as she can. If she hits 200 drums, she can start to make money, equal to 2.5 cents for every drum hit. How many drums does she hit if she lost $7.5 for joining the contest?
Answer: She made $2.5 from hitting drums because 10 - 7.5 = <<10-7.5=2.5>>2.5
She hit 200 drums to start making money
She hit 100 drums in order to make the $2.5 because 2.5/.025 = 100

Question: Levi has 5 lemons. Jayden has 6 more lemons than Levi. Jayden has one-third as many lemons as Eli has while Eli has one-half as many lemons as Ian has. How many lemons do they have in all?
Answer: Jayden has 5 + 6 = <<5+6=11>>11 lemons.
Eli has 11 x 3 = <<11*3=33>>33 lemons.
Ian has 33 x 2 = <<33*2=66>>66 lemons.
Thus, the 4 of them have a total of 5 + 11 + 33 + 66 = <<5+11+33+66=115>>115 lemons.

Q: Nate is feeding his livestock hay. Each goat needs 5 pounds, and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. If there are 15 goats and 12 sheep, how many pounds of hay does Nate need?","A goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
Twice the amount a goat needs is 5 x 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 pounds.
So, a sheep needs 10 - 3 = <<10-3=7>>7 pounds of hay.
Nate needs 15 goats x 5 pounds = <<15*5=75>>75 pounds of hay for the goats.
He also needs 12 sheep x 7 pounds = <<12*7=84>>84 pounds of hay for the sheep.
Therefore, Nate needs a total of 75 + 84 = <<75+84=159>>159 pounds of hay.
