Math,0,"Question: A food truck only sells grilled cheeses.  They source their bread for $3.00 a loaf and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.  They spend $30.00 on different cheeses and condiments per 10 sandwiches.  If they sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, what is their net profit?","First, let's calculate the cost per sandwich:

Cost of bread per sandwich = $3.00 / 10 = $0.30
Cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich = $30.00 / 10 = $3.00

Total cost per sandwich = $0.30 + $3.00 = $3.30

Revenue per 10 sandwiches = 10 sandwiches * $7.00 = $70.00
Cost per 10 sandwiches = 10 sandwiches * $3.30 = $33.00

Net profit = Revenue - Cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

The food truck's net profit for selling 10 grilled cheese sandwiches is $37.00.","They spend $3.00 on bread and $30.00 on cheese and condiments for a total of 3+30 = $<<3+30=33.00>>33.00
They sell 10 sandwiches at $7.00 apiece for a total of 10*7 = $<<10*7=70.00>>70.00
They made $70.00 and spent $33.00 for a net profit of 70-33 = $<<70-33=37.00>>37.00 per 10 sandwiches

Math,1a,"Question: Matt buys a massager.  At the lowest setting, it vibrates at 1600 vibrations per second.  At the highest setting, it vibrates 60% faster.  Matt uses it for 5 minutes at the highest setting.  How many vibrations does he experience?
Answer: At the highest setting, it vibrates 1600*.6=<<1600*.6=960>>960 vibrations per second faster than the lowest setting
So it vibrates at 1600+960=<<1600+960=2560>>2560 vibrations per second
Matt uses it for 5 minutes so that is 5*60=<<5*60=300>>300 seconds

Question: A small pizza can gives 4 slices, and a large pizza gives 8 slices.  George purchased 3 small and 2 large pizzas.  George would like to eat 3 pieces.  His friend Bob would like to eat one more piece than George.  Susie will eat half as many as Bob.  Bill, Fred and Mark would each like 3 pieces.  How many slices of pizza will be left over?
Answer: George has 3 small pizzas * 4 slices = <<3*4=12>>12 pieces.
George also has 2 large pizzas * 8 slices = <<2*8=16>>16 slices.
Total, George has 12 + 16 slices = <<12+16=28>>28 slices of pizza.
Bob will eat 3 slices + 1 = <<3+1=4>>4 slices.
Susie will eat 1/2 * 4 slices = <<1/2*4=2>>2 slices.
Bob, Fred and Mark will eat in total 3 + 3 + 3 = <<3+3+3=9>>9 pieces.
Total slices of pizza eaten will be 3 + 4 + 2 + 9 = <<3+4+2+9=18>>18 pieces.
Total pizza slices remaining will be 28 pieces - 18 = <<28-18=10>>10 slices left.

Question: A food truck only sells grilled cheeses.  They source their bread for $3.00 a loaf and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.  They spend $30.00 on different cheeses and condiments per 10 sandwiches.  If they sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, what is their net profit?","Answer: The cost of bread per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30.
The cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00.
So the total cost per sandwich is $0.30 + $3.00 = $3.30.
They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, so they make a total of $7.00 x 10 = $70.00 in revenue.
Their total cost for the 10 sandwiches is $3.30 x 10 = $33.00.
Therefore, their net profit is $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

Answer: Will paid $30 for his shoes but then returned them and got 90% of the money back, so he lost 10% of the money, which means 10/100 * $30 = $<<10/100*30=3>>3 is gone.

If they sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, what is their net profit?","Answer: The cost per sandwich for bread is $3.00/10 = $0.30.
The total cost per sandwich is $0.30 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese and condiments) = $30.30.
The revenue from selling 10 sandwiches is $7.00/sandwich * 10 sandwiches = $70.00.
The total cost for making 10 sandwiches is $30.30/sandwich * 10 sandwiches = $30.30.
Therefore, the net profit is $70.00 - $30.30 = $39.70.
