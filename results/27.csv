Math,0,"Question: There are four schools competing at a basketball tournament. Each school has sent a girls’ basketball team and a boys’ basketball team and each team has 5 players each. Each school has also sent a coach for each team. In total, how many people have all of the schools sent?","Each school sent a total of 8 people (5 players + 1 coach for girls' team + 1 coach for boys' team + 1 coach for girls' team + 1 coach for boys' team) to the tournament. Since there are 4 schools competing, the total number of people sent by all schools is:

4 schools x 8 people/school = 32 people

Therefore, all of the schools have sent a total of 32 people to the tournament.","Each school has sent 1 girls’ basketball team + 1 boys’ basketball team = <<1+1=2>>2 teams.
So each school has sent 2 teams * 5 players per team = <<2*5=10>>10 players.
They have also each sent 2 teams * 1 coach per team = <<2*1=2>>2 coaches.
In total, each school has sent 10 players + 2 coaches = <<10+2=12>>12 people.
Therefore, the schools have sent a total of 12 people per school * 4 schools = <<12*4=48>>48 people.

Math,1a,"Question: Kim is an office manager. Every morning she spends 5 minutes making coffee, 2 minutes per employee getting a status update, and 3 minutes per employee updating payroll records. If there are 9 employees in the office, how long does Kim's morning routine take?
Answer: First find how many minutes Kim spends on each employee: 2 minutes/employee + 3 minutes/employee = <<2+3=5>>5 minutes/employee
Then multiply that time by the number of employees to find the total time spent on status and payroll updates: 5 minutes/employee * 9 employees = <<5*9=45>>45 minutes
Finally, add that time to the time spent making coffee to find the total time: 45 minutes + 5 minutes = <<45+5=50>>50 minutes

Question: There are four schools competing at a basketball tournament. Each school has sent a girls’ basketball team and a boys’ basketball team and each team has 5 players each. Each school has also sent a coach for each team. In total, how many people have all of the schools sent?","Answer: Each school sends 2 teams with 5 players each, so each school sends 2*5 = 10 players.
With 4 schools competing, the total number of players from all schools is 4*10 = 40 players.
Additionally, each school sends a coach for each team, so each school sends 2 coaches.
Therefore, all of the schools together sent 4*2 = 8 coaches.
Combining both players and coaches, all of the schools have sent 40 players + 8 coaches = 48 people in total.","Each school has sent 1 girls’ basketball team + 1 boys’ basketball team = <<1+1=2>>2 teams.
So each school has sent 2 teams * 5 players per team = <<2*5=10>>10 players.
They have also each sent 2 teams * 1 coach per team = <<2*1=2>>2 coaches.
In total, each school has sent 10 players + 2 coaches = <<10+2=12>>12 people.
Therefore, the schools have sent a total of 12 people per school * 4 schools = <<12*4=48>>48 people.

Math,1b,"Question: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?
Answer: If Mary collected twice the number of red marbles collected by Jenny, she got 2*30 = <<2*30=60>>60 red marbles.
Anie collected 20 more red marbles than Mary, which is 60+20 = 80 red marbles.
The total number of red marbles is 60+80+30 = <<60+80+30=170>>170 red marbles.
If Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles collected by Jenny, then she got 2*25 = <<2*25=50>>50 blue marbles.
Mary collected half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, thus 1/2*50 = 25 marbles
The total number of blue marbles collected is 50+25+25 = <<50+25+25=100>>100 blue marbles

Question: Dexter went to the mall and saw that Apple products are on sale. He wants to buy an iPhone 12 with a 15% discount and an iWatch with a 10% discount. The price tag shows that an iPhone 12 costs $800 while an iWatch costs $300. Upon check out, he will receive a further 2% cashback discount. How much would the items cost in total after the discount and cashback?
Answer: The discount for an iPhone 12 is $800 x 15/100 = $<<800*15/100=120>>120.
So, the iPhone will now cost $800 - $120 = $<<800-120=680>>680.
The discount for an iWatch is $300 x 10/100 = $<<300*10/100=30>>30.
So, the iWatch will now cost $300 - $30 = $<<300-30=270>>270.
The total cost of the iPhone and iWatch is $680 + $270 = $<<680+270=950>>950.
The cashback will be $950 x 2/100 = $<<950*2/100=19>>19.
Thus, Dexter will only pay $950 - $19 = $<<950-19=931>>931.

Each school has also sent a coach for each team. In total, how many people have all of the schools sent?","Answer: Each school has sent 2 teams (girls' and boys' teams) with 5 players each, so that's a total of 2 x 5 = 10 players per school.
Since there are 4 schools competing, the total number of players sent by all schools is 10 x 4 = 40 players.
Each school also sent a coach for each team, so that's 2 coaches per school.
Since there are 4 schools, the total number of coaches sent by all schools is 2 x 4 = 8 coaches.
Therefore, in total, all of the schools have sent 40 players + 8 coaches = 48 people.","Each school has sent 1 girls’ basketball team + 1 boys’ basketball team = <<1+1=2>>2 teams.
So each school has sent 2 teams * 5 players per team = <<2*5=10>>10 players.
They have also each sent 2 teams * 1 coach per team = <<2*1=2>>2 coaches.
In total, each school has sent 10 players + 2 coaches = <<10+2=12>>12 people.
