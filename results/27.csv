Math,1a,"Question: Kris is blowing u balloons for her sister’s party. She has 30 minutes to blow up as many balloons as possible and decides to enlist her brother’s help to increase the number of balloons. Kris can blow up a total of 2 balloon per minute, and her brother works twice as fast. After 15 minutes, her brother doubles his speed and works at this new speed for the remaining 15 minutes. After the 30 minutes, how many balloons, in total, did Kris and her brother blow up?
Answer: Throughout the 30 minutes, Kris blows up 2 balloons per minute * 30 minutes = <<2*30=60>>60 balloons.
Her brother works at double Kris' speed in the first 15 minutes so he works at 2 balloons per minute * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 balloons per minute.
So in the first 15 minutes, he blows up 4 balloons per minute * 15 minutes = <<4*15=60>>60 balloons.
In the second 15 minutes, he is working at double the rate he did previously, so he blows up 4 balloons per minute * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 balloons per minute.
In the second 15 minutes, Kris’ brother therefore blows up 8 balloons per minute * 15 minutes = <<8*15=120>>120 balloons.
Throughout the 30 minutes, he has blown up a total of 60 + 120 = <<60+120=180>>180 balloons.
Kris and her brother therefore blew up a total of 60 balloons from Kris + 180 balloons from Kris’ brother = <<60+180=240>>240 balloons.

Question: One logger can cut down 6 trees per day. The forest is a rectangle measuring 4 miles by 6 miles, and each square mile has 600 trees. If there are 30 days in each month, how many months will it take 8 loggers to cut down all the trees?
Answer: First find the total area of the forest: 4 miles * 6 miles = <<4*6=24>>24 square miles
Then find the total number of trees in that area: 600 trees/square mile * 24 square miles = <<600*24=14400>>14400 trees
Then find the number of trees all the loggers can cut down in one day: 8 loggers * 6 trees/logger = <<8*6=48>>48 trees
Then divide the total number of trees by the number cut down per day to find the number of days it takes to clear the forest: 14400 trees / 48 trees/day = <<14400/48=300>>300 days
Then divide the time in days by the number of days per month to find the time in months: 300 days / 30 days/month = <<300/30=10>>10 months

Question: Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. If Raymond has 40 jewels, how many jewels does Siobhan have?","First, find how many jewels Aaron has by dividing Raymond's jewels by 2 and then adding 5: 40 jewels / 2 = 20 jewels
Aaron has 20 jewels + 5 jewels = 25 jewels
Finally, subtract 2 from Aaron's total to find how many jewels Siobhan has: 25 jewels - 2 jewels = 23 jewels. 
Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.","Half of Raymond's jewels is 40/2 = <<40/2=20>>20
Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, he has 20+5 = <<5+20=25>>25 jewels.
If Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, he has 25-2 = 23 jewels.

Math,1a,"Question: Maya wants to learn how to lift and right now she can only lift a fourth of what America can. America can lift 240 pounds. As Maya grows stronger, she can add 10 more pounds to what she previously could lift. America follows this and now she has hit her peak lift at 300 pounds. If Maya reaches her absolute peak and can lift half of what America can lift, how many more pounds can Maya lift now than when she started?
Answer: Maya can lift 240*0.25=<<240*0.25=60>>60 pounds.
Gaining progress, she can lift up to 60+10=<<60+10=70>>70 pounds.
At her peak, she can lift 300*0.5=<<300*0.5=150>>150 pounds.
Maya's peak is 150 pounds - 60 pounds when she started = <<150-60=90>>90 more pounds than when she started.

Question: Adam has 50 balls. 20 balls are red, 10 are blue, and the rest are either pink or orange. If there are 3 times as many pink as orange balls, how many orange balls are there?
Answer: Adam has a total of 50 balls - 20 red - 10 blue = <<50-20-10=20>>20 pink and orange balls combined
If we let x be the total number of orange balls, we know that 3x is the number of pink balls
Therefore, 20 balls = x + 3x = 4x
The number of orange balls, x, is 20 balls / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 balls

Question: Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. If Raymond has 40 jewels, how many jewels does Siobhan have?","Answer: Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, which means Aaron has 40 jewels / 2 = 20 jewels + 5 = 25 jewels
Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so Siobhan has 25 jewels - 2 = 23 jewels
Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

Question: One logger can cut down 6 trees per day. The forest is a rectangle measuring 4 miles by 6 miles, and each square mile has 600 trees. If there are 30 days in each month, how many months will it take 8 loggers to cut down all the trees?
Answer: First find the total area of the forest: 4 miles * 6 miles = <<4*6=24>>24 square miles
Then find the total number of trees in that area: 600 trees/square mile * 24 square miles = <<600*24=14400>>14400 trees
Then find the number of trees all the loggers can cut down in one day: 8 loggers * 6 trees/logger = <<8*6=48>>48 trees
Then divide the total number of trees by the number cut down per day to find the number of days it takes to clear the forest: 14400 trees / 48 trees/day = <<14400/48=300>>300 days
Then divide the time in days by the number of days per month to find the time in months: 300 days / 30 days/month = <<300/30=10>>10 months
