Math,1a,"Question: An internet provider gives a 5% discount if the customer pays before the 25th day of the month. If the monthly internet rate is $50, how much did the customer pay in all for 4 months if he paid every 25th of the month?
Answer: The 5% discount amounts to $50 x 5/100 = $<<50*5/100=2.50>>2.50.
So the total discount given to the customer for 4 months was $2.50 x 4 = $<<2.5*4=10>>10.
The customer was supposed to pay $50 x 4 = $<<50*4=200>>200 in all for 4 months without discount.
Since the customer is entitled to the discount, then he only paid a total of $200 - $10 = $<<200-10=190>>190 for 4 months.

Question: Mrs. Young makes bonnets for kids in the orphanage. On Monday, she made 10 bonnets, on Tuesday and Wednesday combined she made twice more than on Monday, while on Thursday she made 5 more than on Monday, and on Friday she made 5 less than on Thursday. Then, she divided up the bonnets evenly and sent them to 5 orphanages. How many bonnets did Mrs. Young send to each orphanage?
Answer: She made 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 bonnets on Tuesday and Wednesday.
While on Thursday she made 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 bonnets.
On Friday she made 15 - 5 = <<15-5=10>>10 bonnets.
Mrs. Young made a total of 10 + 20 + 15 + 10 = <<10+20+15+10=55>>55 bonnets for the orphanage.
Therefore, Mrs. Young sends 55 / 5 = <<55/5=11>>11 bonnets to each orphanage.

Question: Robert wants to buy a bookshelf and a sofa and has received two offers. Furniture United's offer includes a $1,350 advance payment and 6 monthly installments of $350 each. Cozy Homes' offer includes a $1,100 advance payment and 9 monthly installments of $250 each. What is the cost difference between the two offers?","To find the total cost for each offer, we need to calculate the sum of the advance payment and the total of the monthly installments.

For Furniture United's offer:
Total cost = $1,350 (advance payment) + 6 x $350 (monthly installments)
Total cost = $1,350 + $2,100
Total cost = $3,450

For Cozy Homes' offer:
Total cost = $1,100 (advance payment) + 9 x $250 (monthly installments)
Total cost = $1,100 + $2,250
Total cost = $3,350

To find the cost difference between the two offers:
Cost difference = Total cost of Furniture United's offer - Total cost of Cozy Homes' offer
Cost difference = $3,450 - $3,350
Cost difference = $100

Therefore, the cost difference between the two offers is $100.","Furniture United's offer is 1,350 + (6 *350) = $<<1350+(6*350)=3450>>3,450
Cozy Homes's offer is 1,100 + (9 * 250) = $<<1100+9*250=3350>>3,350
The difference is 3,450 – 3,350 = $<<3450-3350=100>>100

Math,1a,"Question: Ben's potato gun can launch a potato 6 football fields. If a football field is 200 yards long and Ben's dog can run 400 feet/minute, how many minutes will it take his dog to fetch a potato he launches?
Answer: First find the total distance the potato flies in yards: 200 yards/field * 6 fields = 1200 yards
Then multiply that number by the number of feet per yard to convert it to feet: 1200 yards * 3 feet/yard = <<1200*3=3600>>3600 feet
Then divide that number by the dog's speed to find the number of minutes it has to run to fetch the potato: 3600 feet / 400 feet/minute = <<3600/400=9>>9 minutes

Question: Danny has 3 bottles of soda. He drinks 90% of one bottle and gives 70% of the other two bottles to his friends. How much soda does Danny have left, expressed as a percentage of a bottle?
Answer: First find how much soda Danny drank: 1 bottle * .9 = <<1*.9=.9>>.9 bottles
Then find how much soda Danny gave to his friends: 2 friends * 1 bottle/friend * .7 = <<2*1*.7=1.4>>1.4 bottles
Now subtract the soda drunk and given away to find the remaining amount of soda: 3 bottles - .9 bottles - 1.4 bottles = .7 bottles * 100% = 70%

To find the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer, add the advance payment to the total of the monthly installments: $1,100 + (9 * $250) = $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now subtract Cozy Homes' total cost from Furniture United's total cost to find the cost difference: $3,450 - $3,350 = $100

Therefore, the cost difference between the two offers is $100.","Furniture United's offer is 1,350 + (6 *350) = $<<1350+(6*350)=3450>>3,450
Cozy Homes's offer is 1,100 + (9 * 250) = $<<1100+9*250=3350>>3,350

What is the cost difference between the two offers?","To find the total cost for Furniture United's offer, we first calculate the total cost of the monthly installments: 6 months * $350/month = $2100

For Cozy Homes' offer, we calculate the total cost of the monthly installments: 9 months * $250/month = $2250
Adding the advance payment to this gives a total cost of $2250 + $1100 = $3350 for Cozy Homes' offer.

Finally, we find the cost difference between the two offers by subtracting the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer from Furniture United's offer: $3450 - $3350 = $<<3450-3350=100>>100
