Math,0,"Question: Elaina is holding the final concert in her tour. To celebrate her final concert, she makes the concert twice as long as her usual concerts. At the end of the concert, she also performs a 15-minute encore. If the runtime of this final concert is 65 minutes then how long, in minutes, do her usual concerts run for?","Let x be the length of Elaina's usual concerts.

Given that her final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts plus a 15-minute encore, we can create the following equation:

2x + 15 = 65

Solving for x:

2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50
x = 25

Therefore, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.","The concert, minus the encore, lasted for 65-minute concert – 15-minute encore = <<65-15=50>>50 minutes.
This is twice as long as her usual concerts so her usual concert must have a runtime of 50 minutes / 2 = <<50/2=25>>25 minutes.

Question: Armand is playing a guessing game with his dad where he has to guess a number his dad is thinking of. His dad tells him that the number, when multiplied by 3, is three less than twice 51. What is the number?
Answer: 102 is twice 51 because 2 x 51 = <<2*51=102>>102
Three less than 102 is 99 because 102 -3 = <<102-3=99>>99
The number is 33 because 99 / 3 = <<99/3=33>>33

Math,1b,"Question: Sara is checking out two different stores to buy a computer. The first store offers a device for $950 with a 6% discount. The second sells the same computer for €920 with a 5% discount. What is the difference in price between the two stores?
Answer: The amount of discount in the first store 950 x 6/100 = $<<950*6/100=57>>57.
So, the device costs 950 - 57 = $<<950-57=893>>893 in the first store.
The amount of discount in the second store is 920 x 5/100 = $<<920*5/100=46>>46.
So, the device costs 920 - 46 = $<<920-46=874>>874 in the second store.
The difference in price is 893 - 874 = $<<893-874=19>>19.

Question: On Mary's birthday, her brother surprised her with $100. She spent a quarter of it on a new video game and then used a fifth of what was left on swimming goggles. How much money did she have left?
Answer: Mary spent 100/4= <<100/4=25>>25 dollars on a new video game.
So, after the video game purchase, Mary was left with 100 - 25 = <<100-25=75>>75 dollars.

At the end of the concert, she also performs a 15-minute encore. If the runtime of this final concert is 65 minutes then how long, in minutes, do her usual concerts run for?","Let the usual length of Elaina's concerts be x minutes.

During her final concert, Elaina performs for 2x (twice as long as usual) + 15 minutes for the encore, which totals to 2x + 15 minutes.

Given that the final concert is 65 minutes long, we can set up the equation: 2x + 15 = 65

Subtracting 15 from both sides gives: 2x = 50

Dividing by 2 on both sides gives: x = 25

Therefore, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.","The concert, minus the encore, lasted for 65-minute concert – 15-minute encore = <<65-15=50>>50 minutes.
