Math,0,"Question: Bob is in charge of doing laundry for a large hotel. Each room has two sheets, one comforter, twice as many pillow cases as sheets and twice as many towels as pillow cases. How many pieces of laundry are there in 80 rooms?","In each room, there are:
- 2 sheets
- 1 comforter
- 4 pillow cases
- 8 towels

So, for each room, there are a total of 2+1+4+8 = 15 pieces of laundry.

In 80 rooms, there would be a total of 80 x 15 = 1200 pieces of laundry.","First find the number of pillow cases in each room: 2 sheets * 2 pillow cases/sheet = <<2*2=4>>4 pillow cases
Then find the number of towels in each room: 4 pillow cases * 2 towels/pillow case = <<4*2=8>>8 towels
Then find the number of pieces of laundry in each room: 4 pillow cases + 8 towels + 2 sheets + 1 comforter = <<4+8+2+1=15>>15 pieces of laundry
Then multiply the number of pieces of laundry in each room by the number of rooms to find the total: 15 pieces of laundry/room * 80 rooms = <<15*80=1200>>1200 pieces

Math,1a,"Question: Cecil has $600. Catherine has $250 less than twice as much as Cecil while Carmela has $50 more than twice Cecil's money. How much money do they have altogether?
Answer: Twice as much as Cecil's money is $600 x 2 = $<<600*2=1200>>1200.
So, Catherine has $1200 - $250 = $<<1200-250=950>>950.
While Carmela has $1200 + $50 = $<<1200+50=1250>>1250.
Hence, they have a total of $600 + $950 + $1250 = $<<600+950+1250=2800>>2800.

Question: Julie started her own landscaping business. She charges $4 an hour for mowing lawns and $8 for pulling weeds. In September she mowed lawns for 25 hours and pulled weeds for 3 hours. If she worked the same number of hours in October, how much money did she earn in September and October?
Answer: She mowed lawns for 25 hours in September, so earned 25 * $4= $<<25*4=100>>100.
She pulled weeds for 3 hours in September, so earned 3 * $8= $<<3*8=24>>24.
She earned $100 + $24 = $<<100+24=124>>124 in September.
Finally, for two months working the same hours she earned $124 * 2 = $<<124*2=248>>248.
