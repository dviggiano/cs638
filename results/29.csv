Math,0,"Question: Candy has 15 light blue spools of thread, 45 dark blue spools of thread, 40 light green spools of thread, and 50 dark green spools of thread. What percent of her spools are blue?","First, we need to find the total number of spools Candy has. 

Total spools = 15 light blue + 45 dark blue + 40 light green + 50 dark green
Total spools = 150 spools

Next, we need to find the total number of blue spools Candy has.

Total blue spools = 15 light blue + 45 dark blue
Total blue spools = 60 spools

Finally, we can calculate the percentage of blue spools Candy has.

Percentage of blue spools = (Total blue spools / Total spools) * 100
Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100
Percentage of blue spools = 40%

Therefore, 40% of Candy's spools are blue.","First find the number of blue spools: 15 spools + 45 spools = <<15+45=60>>60 spools
Then find the total number of spools: 40 spools + 50 spools + 60 spools = <<40+50+60=150>>150 spools
Then divide the number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 60 spools / 150 spools * 100% = 40%

Math,1a,"Question: Kristy, a sales representative earns a basic salary of $7.50 per hour plus a 16% commission on everything she sells. This month, she worked for 160 hours and sold $25000 worth of items. Her monthly budget for food, clothing, rent, transportation, bills and savings is 95% of her total monthly earnings and the rest will be put towards insurance. How much did she allocate to insurance?
Answer: Kristy earns a basic salary of $7.50 x 160 = $<<7.5*160=1200>>1200.
Her total commission is $25000 x 16/100 = $<<25000*16/100=4000>>4000.
Thus, her total earning is $1200 + $4000 = $<<1200+4000=5200>>5200.
Her monthly budget aside from the insurance is $5200 x 95/100 = $<<5200*95/100=4940>>4940.
Therefore, she allocated $5200 - $4940 = $<<5200-4940=260>>260 on insurance.

Question: Mickey and Johnny are having a contest to see who can run around their block the most. One time around the block equals 200 meters. Johnny runs around the block 4 times. Mickey runs around the block half as many times as Johnny. What is the average distance run by Johnny and Mickey?
Answer: Mickey runs around the block twice because half of 4 is <<4/2=2>>2.
Mickey runs 400 meters in total because 2 times 200 equals <<2*200=400>>400.
Johnny runs 800 meters because 4 times 200 equals <<4*200=800>>800.
In total, they run 1200 meters because 400 plus 800 equals 1200.
On average, they run 600 meters because 1200 divided by 2 equals <<1200/2=600>>600
