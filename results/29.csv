Math,0,"Question: The population of porcupines in a park is 50. The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population. If each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, how many porcupines will be in the park after a year?","First, we need to calculate the number of female porcupines in the park:

Number of female porcupines = (3/5) * 50 = 30

Now, we need to calculate the number of babies born each month:

Number of babies born each month = 30 * 4 = 120

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of porcupines born each month is 120.

After a year (12 months), the total number of porcupines in the park will be:

Total number of porcupines = 50 (original population) + 120 (babies born each month * 12 months) = 50 + 1440 = 1490

Therefore, there will be 1490 porcupines in the park after a year.","The number of female porcupines in the park is 3/5*50 = <<3/5*50=30>>30.
In a month, the 30 female porcupines give birth to 30*4 = <<30*4=120>>120 new babies.
After a year, with 12 months, the total number of new porcupines in the park is 120*12 = <<120*12=1440>>1440
The total population of porcupines in the park after a year is 50+1440 = <<50+1440=1490>>1490

Math,1a,"Question: 4/5 of the Easter eggs are blue and 1/5 are purple. Half the purple eggs have five pieces of candy each, and 1/4 of the blue eggs do. The rest of the eggs only have one piece of candy. If Jerry opens one egg at random, what is the percentage chance he'll get 5 pieces of candy?
Answer: First find the probability Jerry gets a blue egg with 5 pieces of candy by multiplying the independent probabilities: 4/5 * 1/4 = 1/5 = 20%
Then find the probability he gets a purple egg with 5 pieces of candy the same way: 1/5 * 1/2 = 1/10 = 10%
Then add the probabilities of the two possible ways to get 5 pieces of candy to find the total probability: 20% + 10% = 30%

Question: Jamie and Oliver are planning to go on a vacation. A plane ticket costs $24 for each person and a hotel stay costs $12 for each person per day. How much money will they spend on the vacation if they stay for 3 days?
Answer: Jamie and Oliver will spend $24 x 2 = $<<24*2=48>>48 for the plane ticket.
They will spend $12 x 2 = $<<12*2=24>>24 for staying in the hotel per day.
So, the total amount they will spend on the hotel for a 3-day stay is $24 x 3 = $<<24*3=72>>72.
Therefore, the total amount they will spend on their vacation is $72 + $48 = $<<72+48=120>>120.

Question: The population of porcupines in a park is 50. The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population. If each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, how many porcupines will be in the park after a year?","Answer: The number of female porcupines is 3/5 * 50 = <<3/5*50=30>>30.
If each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of babies born in a month is 30 * 4 = <<30*4=120>>120.
After a year (12 months), the total number of new porcupines born will be 120 * 12 = <<120*12=1440>>1440.
Adding this to the current population, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be 50 (current population) + 1440 (new porcupines born) = <<50+1440=1490>>1490. 
Therefore, there will be 1490 porcupines in the park after a year.","The number of female porcupines in the park is 3/5*50 = <<3/5*50=30>>30.
In a month, the 30 female porcupines give birth to 30*4 = <<30*4=120>>120 new babies.
After a year, with 12 months, the total number of new porcupines in the park is 120*12 = <<120*12=1440>>1440
The total population of porcupines in the park after a year is 50+1440 = <<50+1440=1490>>1490

Answer: Of the males with stripes, 40% are babies because 100 - 60 = <<100-60=40>>40
There are 10 males with stripes because 4 / .4 = <<4/.4=10>>10
There are 40 males because 10 / (1/4) = <<10/(1/4)=40>>40
