Math,1a,"Question: James has a small tree outside his window with 30 branches with 90 twigs per branch. 30% of the twigs sprout 4 leaves and the rest sprout 5 leaves. How many leaves are on the tree total?
Answer: First find the total number of twigs on the tree: 30 branches * 90 twigs/branch = <<30*90=2700>>2700 twigs
Then multiply that number by 30% to find how many twigs have 4 leaves: 2700 twigs * 30% = <<2700*30*.01=810>>810 twigs
Then subtract that number from the total number of twigs to find how many have 5 leaves: 2700 twigs - 810 twigs = <<2700-810=1890>>1890 twigs
Then multiply that number by 5 to find the number of leaves on the 5-leaved twigs: 1890 twigs * 5 leaves/twig = <<1890*5=9450>>9450 leaves
Then multiply the number of 4-leaved twigs by 4 to find the total number of leaves they have: 810 twigs * 4 leaves/twig = <<810*4=3240>>3240 leaves
Then add the two groups of leaves to find the total number of leaves: 9450 leaves + 3240 leaves = <<9450+3240=12690>>12690 leaves

Question: Larry and Barry want to pick apples out of the tree, but neither is tall enough to reach the apples.  Barry can reach apples that are 5 feet high.  Larry is 5 feet tall, but his shoulder height is 20% less than his full height.  If Barry stands on Larry's shoulders, how high can they reach?
Answer: Larry's shoulder height is 20% less than 5 feet, or 0.2*5 =<<20*.01*5=1>>1 foot less than 5 feet.
One foot less than 5 feet is 5-1=<<5-1=4>>4 feet.
If Barry stands on Larry's shoulders, they can reach 4+5=<<4+5=9>>9 feet.

Question: In a room, there are various toys: 5 red cars, 3 action figures, and a doll. The doll cost as much as 3 action figures and one red car cost $4. How much are all toys worth, of an action figure costs $5?","Answer: The doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.
The 5 red cars cost 5 * $4 = $20.
So, in total, all toys are worth $20 + $15 + 3 * $5 = $50.","Three actions figures are worth 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15, as much as the doll.
The red cars are worth 5 * 4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.
So all toys are worth 20 + 15 + 15 = $<<20+15+15=50>>50.

Math,1a,"Question: Jose bought 20,000 square meters of land and needs to divide it equally with his four siblings. How much land, in the square meters, will Jose have after dividing it with his siblings?
Answer: The land will be divided into 1 (Jose) + 4 siblings = <<1+4=5>>5 pieces.
So, Jose will have 20,000/5 = <<20000/5=4000>>4000 square meters of land.

Question: A building has 10 floors. It takes 15 seconds to go up the stairs to the even-numbered floors and 9 seconds to go up to the odd-numbered floors.  This includes getting to the first floor. How many minutes does it take to get to the 10th floor?
Answer: So for all even-numbered floors (2, 4, 6, 8, 10), it takes 5*15= <<5*15=75>>75 seconds
And for all odd-numbered floors (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) it takes 5*9= <<5*9=45>>45 seconds
To climb all the floors, it takes 75+45= <<75+45=120>>120 seconds

The total cost of the red cars is 5*4=<<5*4=20>>20 dollars.
The cost of all the toys is 20+15+5*3= <<20+15+(5*3)=50>>50 dollars.","Three actions figures are worth 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15, as much as the doll.
The red cars are worth 5 * 4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.

Question: In a room, there are various toys: 5 red cars, 3 action figures, and a doll. The doll cost as much as 3 action figures and one red car cost $4. How much are all toys worth, of an action figure costs $5?","First, let's determine the total cost of the red cars. Since each red car costs $4 and there are 5 red cars, the total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

Next, let's determine the total cost of the action figures. Since each action figure costs $5 and there are 3 action figures, the total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, let's determine the cost of the doll. Since the doll cost as much as 3 action figures, it costs 3 * $5 = $15.

Finally, to find the total cost of all toys, we add the cost of the red cars, action figures, and doll: $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

Therefore, all the toys are worth $50.","Three actions figures are worth 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15, as much as the doll.
The red cars are worth 5 * 4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.
