Math,1a,"Question: Debelyn, Christel, and Andrena collect dolls. Debelyn had 20 dolls before she gave Andrena 2 dolls. Christel had 24 dolls before giving Andrena 5 dolls. After all the gifts, Andrena now has 2 more dolls  than Christel, how many more dolls does andrena have now than Debelyn?
Answer: Debelyn had 20 - 2 = <<20-2=18>>18 dolls left after giving out 2 dolls to Christel.
Christel had 24 + 2 = <<24+2=26>>26 dolls after receiving 2 dolls from Debelyn.
Christel had 24 - 5 = <<24-5=19>>19 dolls after giving Andrena 5 dolls.
So, Andrena has 19 +2 = <<19+2=21>>21 dolls now.
Therefore, Andrena has 21 - 18 = <<21-18=3>>3 more dolls than Debelyn.

Question: Jenny wants to read 3 books in the next 10 days. She can read 100 words per hour. If the first book has 200 words, the second book has 400 words, and the third book has 300 words, how many minutes per day, on average, should she spend reading?
Answer: She wants to read 200+400+300=<<200+400+300=900>>900 pages total.
She needs to spend 900/100 = <<900/100=9>>9 hours reading in the next three weeks.
In minutes, she will need to spend 9*60 = <<9*60=540>>540 minutes.
Thus, she should spend 540 minutes/10 days = <<540/10=54>>54 minutes per day reading.

Q: There are four schools competing at a basketball tournament. Each school has sent a girls’ basketball team and a boys’ basketball team and each team has 5 players each. Each school has also sent a coach for each team. In total, how many people have all of the schools sent?","A: Each school has sent 2 teams (girls' team and boys' team) with 5 players each, so each school has sent a total of 2 teams x 5 players = 10 players.
Since there are 4 schools competing, the total number of players sent by all schools is 10 players per school x 4 schools = 40 players.
Additionally, each school has sent a coach for each team, so each school has sent 2 coaches per school.
Therefore, in total, all of the schools have sent 2 coaches per school x 4 schools = 8 coaches.
Adding the players and coaches together, all of the schools have sent a total of 40 players + 8 coaches = 48 people.","Each school has sent 1 girls’ basketball team + 1 boys’ basketball team = <<1+1=2>>2 teams.
So each school has sent 2 teams * 5 players per team = <<2*5=10>>10 players.
They have also each sent 2 teams * 1 coach per team = <<2*1=2>>2 coaches.
In total, each school has sent 10 players + 2 coaches = <<10+2=12>>12 people.
Therefore, the schools have sent a total of 12 people per school * 4 schools = <<12*4=48>>48 people.

Question: It takes 50 large jelly beans to fill up a large drinking glass.  It takes half that amount to fill up a small drinking glass.  If there are 5 large drinking glasses and 3 small ones, how many jellybeans will it take to fill them up?
Answer: A small drinking glass takes half the amount of a large glass that needs 50 so it will take 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 jellybeans
5 large glasses need to be filled so they will take 5*50 = <<5*50=250>>250 jelly beans
There are 3 small glasses that need to be filled so they will take 3*25 = <<3*25=75>>75 jelly beans
All total, to fill all the glasses it will take 250+75 = <<250+75=325>>325 jellybeans

Q: There are four schools competing at a basketball tournament. Each school has sent a girls’ basketball team and a boys’ basketball team and each team has 5 players each. Each school has also sent a coach for each team. In total, how many people have all of the schools sent?","A: Each school has sent 2 teams consisting of 5 players each, so each school has sent 2*5 = <<2*5=10>>10 players.
Since there are 4 schools, the total number of players sent to the tournament is 4*10 = <<4*10=40>>40 players.
Each school has also sent a coach for each team, so each school has sent 2 coaches each. This means that for 4 schools, there are 4*2 = <<4*2=8>>8 coaches in total.
Adding the players and coaches together, all of the schools have sent a total of 40 players + 8 coaches = <<40+8=48>>48 people to the tournament. 
Therefore, all of the schools have sent a total of 48 people to the basketball tournament.","Each school has sent 1 girls’ basketball team + 1 boys’ basketball team = <<1+1=2>>2 teams.
So each school has sent 2 teams * 5 players per team = <<2*5=10>>10 players.
They have also each sent 2 teams * 1 coach per team = <<2*1=2>>2 coaches.
In total, each school has sent 10 players + 2 coaches = <<10+2=12>>12 people.
Therefore, the schools have sent a total of 12 people per school * 4 schools = <<12*4=48>>48 people.
