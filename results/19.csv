Math,0,"Question: A plague infects ten people. Every day, each infected person infects six others. How many people are infected after three days?","Let's break down the number of infected people for each day:

Day 1:
Initial infected people: 10
New infections: 10 * 6 = 60
Total infected on day 1: 10 (initial) + 60 (new) = 70

Day 2:
Total infected on day 1: 70
New infections: 70 * 6 = 420
Total infected on day 2: 70 (day 1) + 420 (new) = 490

Day 3:
Total infected on day 2: 490
New infections: 490 * 6 = 2940
Total infected on day 3: 490 (day 2) + 2940 (new) = 3430

Therefore, after three days, a total of 3430 people are infected.","On the first day, the original ten people infect six people each, so 10 * 6 = <<10*6=60>>60 more people are infected.
There are 10 + 60 = <<10+60=70>>70 infected people after the first day.
On the second day, 70 * 6 = <<70*6=420>>420 more people are infected.
There are 70 + 420 = <<70+420=490>>490 infected people after the second day.
On the third day, 490 * 6 = 2940 more people are infected. Therefore, there are 490 + 2940 = 3430 infected people after three days.

Question: Joanie wants to join a gym to get into shape. The gym costs $12 per month and has a $50 down payment. How much will she need to pay for the first 3 years?
Answer: The membership costs $12 * 12 months = $<<12*12=144>>144 per year.
For three years, the monthly membership fee will be $144 * 3 = $<<144*3=432>>432.
The total amount paid for 3 years will be $432 + $50 = $<<432+50=482>>482.

Question: A plague infects ten people. Every day, each infected person infects six others. How many people are infected after three days?","Answer: 
Day 0: 10 infected people
Day 1: 10 + (10 * 6) = 70 infected people
Day 2: 70 + (70 * 6) = 490 infected people
Day 3: 490 + (490 * 6) = 3430 infected people
After three days, there will be a total of 3430 infected people.","On the first day, the original ten people infect six people each, so 10 * 6 = <<10*6=60>>60 more people are infected.
There are 10 + 60 = <<10+60=70>>70 infected people after the first day.
On the second day, 70 * 6 = <<70*6=420>>420 more people are infected.
There are 70 + 420 = <<70+420=490>>490 infected people after the second day.
On the third day, 490 * 6 = 2940 more people are infected. Therefore, there are 490 + 2940 = 3430 infected people after three days.

Math,1b,"Question: Mr. Shaefer harvested 500 lychees in a carton and took them to the market. He sold half of them and took home the remaining number of lychees where they ate 3/5 of them. Calculate the number of lychees remaining.
Answer: At the market, Mr. Shaefer sold half of the lychees, which is 1/2*500 = 250
The remaining number of lychees is 500-250 = <<500-250=250>>250
At home, they ate 3/5*250 = <<3/5*250=150>>150 lychees.

Question: A highway is being extended from its current length of 200 miles up to 650 miles. 50 miles are built on the first day, and three times this amount are built on the second day.  How many miles still need to be added to the highway to finish extending it?
Answer: The length of the highway that needs to be constructed is 650 – 200 = <<650-200=450>>450 miles.
After the first day, there are still 450 – 50 = <<450-50=400>>400 miles that need to be constructed.
