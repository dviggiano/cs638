Math,0,"Question: Well's mother sells watermelons, peppers, and oranges at the local store. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs. An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon cost. Dillon is sent to the store to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. What's the total amount of money he will spend if each pepper costs 15$?","First, we need to determine the costs of each fruit.

Let x be the cost of each pepper.
Then a watermelon costs 3x.
An orange costs (3x - 5).

Given that each pepper costs $15, x = 15.

So, a watermelon costs 3 * 15 = 45.
An orange costs 45 - 5 = 40.

Now, calculate the total amount of money Dillon will spend:

4 watermelons * 45 = $180
20 peppers * 15 = $300
10 oranges * 40 = $400

Therefore, Dillon will spend $180 + $300 + $400 = $880 in total.","A watermelon costs three times what pepper costs, which is 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.
An orange price is 45 - 5= $<<45-5=40>>40.
Dillon buys four watermelons at a total cost of 45 * 4 = $<<45*4=180>>180.
He also purchases peppers at a total price of 20 * 15 = $<<20*15=300>>300.
The oranges cost him a total of 10 * 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.
He used a total of 400 + 300 + 180 = $<<400+300+180=880>>880.

Math,1a,"Question: Andy is checking to see if all the cars in the parking lot paid for their parking. 75% of the cars have valid tickets, and 1/5th that number have permanent parking passes. If there are 300 cars in the parking lot, how many people tried to park in the lot without paying?
Answer: First find how many cars have valid tickets: 75% * 300 cars = <<75*.01*300=225>>225 cars
Then find the percentage of cars with parking passes: 75% / 5 = 15%
Then multiply that number by the total number of cars to find the number with parking passes: 15% * 300 cars = <<15*.01*300=45>>45 cars
Then subtract all the cars with valid forms of parking to find the number parked illegally: 300 cars - 225 cars - 45 cars = <<300-225-45=30>>30 cars

Question: Nancy replaced all of the old vinyl tiles in her bathroom with new hardwood flooring.  She replaced flooring in two areas of the bathroom: a 10 foot by 10 foot central area, and a 6 foot by 4 foot hallway.  How many square feet of hardwood flooring did Nancy install in her bathroom?
Answer: 10 feet by 10 feet central area is 10*10=<<10*10=100>>100 square feet of space.
6 feet by 4 feet hallway is 4*6-24 square feet of space.
Combined, the two areas where she replaced flooring contain 100+24=<<100+24=124>>124 square feet of space.

Dillon is sent to the store to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. What's the total amount of money he will spend if each pepper costs 15$?","First, we need to find the cost of a watermelon. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs and each pepper costs $15, the watermelon costs 3*15 = $45.

Next, we need to find the cost of an orange. Since an orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs and a watermelon costs $45, an orange costs $45 - 5 = $40.

Dillon is buying 4 watermelons at $45 each, which will cost 4*45 = $180.
He is also buying 20 peppers at $15 each, which will cost 20*15 = $300.
And he is buying 10 oranges at $40 each, which will cost 10*40 = $400.

Therefore, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is 180 + 300 + 400 = $880.","A watermelon costs three times what pepper costs, which is 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.

Math,1b,"Question: Belle eats 4 dog biscuits and 2 rawhide bones every evening. If each rawhide bone is $1, and each dog biscuit is $0.25, then how much does it cost, in dollars, to feed Belle these treats for a week?
Answer: A week's worth of rawhide bones cost 1*2*7=<<1*2*7=14>>14 dollars.
A week's worth of dog biscuits cost 0.25*4*7=<<0.25*4*7=7>>7 dollars,

Question: How many apples did two men and three women buy at a certain store if the two men each bought 30 apples, 20 less than the number of apples bought by each woman?
Answer: If the two men each bought 30 apples, together they bought 2*30 = <<2*30=60>>60 apples.
Since the two men each bought 30 apples, 20 less than the total number of apples bought by each woman, each woman bought 20+30 = <<20+30=50>>50 apples.
The total number of apples bought by the women is 3*50 = <<3*50=150>>150
Altogether, the two men and three women bought 60+150 = <<60+150=210>>210 apples.

Dillon is sent to the store to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. What's the total amount of money he will spend if each pepper costs 15$?","To find out how much each watermelon costs, we know that a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs. Since each pepper costs $15, a watermelon costs 3*15 = $45.

An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so an orange costs $45 - $5 = $40.

Dillon is sent to the store to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. The total cost of the watermelons is 4 * $45 = $180.
The total cost of the peppers is 20 * $15 = $300.
The total cost of the oranges is 10 * $40 = $400.

Therefore, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.","A watermelon costs three times what pepper costs, which is 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.
