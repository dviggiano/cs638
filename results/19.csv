Math,1a,"Question: Jake and Penny are hunting snakes. Jake's snake is 12 inches longer than Jenny's snake. If the two snakes have a combined length of 70 inches, how long is Jake's snake?
Answer: Let j be the length of Jake's snake and p be length of Penny's snake. We know that j + p = 70, and j = p + 12.
We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get p + 12 + p = 70
Combining like terms, we get 2p + 12 = 70
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get 2p = 58
Dividing both sides by 2, we get p = 58 / 2 = <<58/2=29>>29 inches. Penny's snake is 29 inches.
Substituting that length in to the equation j = p + 12, we get j = 29 inches + 12 inches = <<29+12=41>>41 inches

Question: Carly is a pet groomer. Today, her task was trimming the four nails on dogs’ paws. She trimmed 164 nails, but three of the dogs had only three legs. How many dogs did Carly work on?
Answer: Let N be the number of dogs with 4 legs Carly worked on.
All the dogs with 4 legs had 4N paws.
There were 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 paws on dogs with 3 legs.
At 4 nails per paw, she trimmed 164 / 4 = <<164/4=41>>41 paws.
She worked on 4N + 9 = 41 paws.
Thus, she worked on 4N = 32 paws on dogs with 4 legs.
She worked on N = 32 / 4 = <<32/4=8>>8 dogs with 4 legs.
Thus, Carly worked on 8 + 3 = <<8+3=11>>11 dogs.

Q: Bethany can run 10 laps on the track in one hour.  Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany.  Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey.  Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn.  How many more laps can Bethany run compared to Quinn?","Let's first determine how many laps each person can run:
- Bethany: 10 laps
- Trey: 10 laps + 4 laps = 14 laps
- Shaelyn: 14 laps / 2 = 7 laps
- Quinn: 7 laps - 2 laps = 5 laps

Now, let's calculate the difference between the number of laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn:
Bethany - Quinn = 10 laps - 5 laps = 5 laps

Therefore, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn.","Trey can run 10 + 4 = <<10+4=14>>14 laps in one hour.
Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = <<14/2=7>>7 laps in one hour.
Quinn can run 7 - 2 = <<7-2=5>>5 laps.
Bethany can run 10 - 5 = <<10-5=5>>5 more laps compared to Quinn.

Math,1a,"Question: Hattie and her friend Lorelei are doing a jumping contest using a jumping rope. Hattie does 180 jumps in the first round, while Lorelei jumps 3/4 as many times as Hattie jumped. In the second round, Lorelei does 50 more jumps than Hattie. If Hattie managed to jump 2/3 times the number of jumps she did in the first round, calculate the total number of jumps the two did in the two rounds.
Answer: In the first round, Lorelei did 3/4 * 180 jumps = <<3/4*180=135>>135 jumps.
In the second round, Hattie did 2/3 * 180 jumps = <<2/3*180=120>>120 jumps, while
Lorelei did 120 jumps + 50 jumps = <<120+50=170>>170 jumps.
The total number of jumps for the two in both rounds is 170 jumps + 120 jumps + 135 jumps + 180 jumps = <<170+120+135+180=605>>605 jumps

Answer: Let j be the length of Jake's snake and p be length of Penny's snake. We know that j + p = 70, and j = p + 12.
