Math,1a,"Question: Joshua bought 25 oranges for $12.50. If he sells each one for 60c, how much profit in cents will he make on each orange?
Answer: $1 is equivalent to 100 cents so $12.50 is equivalent to 100*12.50 = <<12.50*100=1250>>1250 cents
He bought 25 oranges for 1250 cents so each orange cost 1250/25 = <<1250/25=50>>50 cents each
If he sells each orange for 60 cents, he is making a profit of 60-50 = <<60-50=10>>10 cents on each one.

Question: Stephen rides his bicycle to church.  During the first third of his trip, he travels at a speed of 16 miles per hour. During the second third of his trip, riding uphill, he travels a speed of 12 miles per hour.  During the last third of his trip, he rides downhill at a speed of 20 miles per hour.  If each third of his trip takes 15 minutes, what is the distance Stephen rides his bicycle to church, in miles?
Answer: 15 minutes is 15/60=<<15/60=0.25>>0.25 hours.
Traveling 15 minutes at 16 miles per hour, Stephen travels 16*0.25 = 4 miles.
Traveling 15 minutes at 12 miles per hour, Stephen travels 12*0.25 = 3 miles.
Traveling 15 minutes at 20 miles per hour, Stephen travels 20*0.25 = 5 miles.
All together, Stephen travels 4+3+5=<<4+3+5=12>>12 miles.

Question: Katerina makes designer jewelry.  Her specialty is topaz necklaces.  She uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace, and fills the space between gemstones using sterling silver beads.  If each topaz gemstone is one inch long, each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, and each necklace is made to a total length of 25 inches, how many sterling silver beads does Katerina use per necklace?","Answer: The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. Since each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long and there are 8 gemstones per necklace, the gemstones take up 8*1 = 8 inches.
This means there are 25-8 = <<25-8=17>>17 inches of space between gemstones.
Since each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, Katerina uses 17/(1/4) = 17*4 = <<17*4=68>>68 sterling silver beads per necklace. 
Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.","8 topaz gemstones, at 1 inch per gemstone, contribute a total of 8*1=<<8*1=8>>8 inches to each necklace.
Since each necklace is 25 inches in length, then there are 25-8=<<25-8=17>>17 inches of space between gemstones.
Since Katerina uses one-quarter inch sterling silver beads to fill space between gemstones, then she will require 17*4=<<17*4=68>>68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

Question: Annie is building a diorama for her history class. The amount of time she spent building it is equal to three times the amount of time she spent planning it minus 5 minutes. If she spent 67 minutes on the diorama total, how many minutes did she spend building it?
Answer: Let p be the planning time in minutes and b be the building time. We know that b = 3p - 5 and b + p = 67
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 3p - 5 + p = 67
Combining like terms, we get 4p - 5 = 67
Adding 5 to both sides, we get 4p = 72
Dividing both sides by 4, we get p = 18
Substituting this value into b = 3p - 5, we find that b = 3 * 18 - 5 = <<3*18-5=49>>49

If each topaz gemstone is one inch long, each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, and each necklace is made to a total length of 25 inches, how many sterling silver beads does Katerina use per necklace?","Answer: The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long. Therefore, the total length of the topaz gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches.
The remaining length to be filled by sterling silver beads is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.
Since each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace is 17 / (1/4) = 17 * 4 = <<17*4=68>>68 beads.
Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.
