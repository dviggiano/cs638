Question: John likes to have a glass of water with breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Finally, he has one before he goes to bed as well.  John does this every weekday, but on the weekends he likes to relax and have a soda with dinner instead.  How many glasses of water does John drink in a week?","Answer: John drinks 3 glasses of water each for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, totaling 3+3+3=9 glasses on weekdays.
