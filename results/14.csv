Math,0,"Question: Nate's dog can dig six holes a day. He digs for 14 days while Nate is on vacation. When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. How many weeks does it take him to fill in all the holes?","First, we need to find out how many holes the dog dug while Nate was on vacation. Since the dog can dig 6 holes a day and dug for 14 days, the total number of holes dug by the dog is 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.

When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day and the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes being filled in every day is 9 holes/day - 6 holes/day = 3 holes/day.

To find out how many days it will take Nate to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes dug by the net number of holes being filled in every day: 84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, it will take Nate 28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks to fill in all the holes dug by the dog.","First find the number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation: 14 days * 6 holes/day = <<14*6=84>>84 holes
Then find the net number of holes Nate fill in each day: 9 holes/day - 6 holes/day = <<9-6=3>>3 holes/day
Then divide the total number of holes by the daily decrease in the number of holes to find the number of days Nate spends filling in holes: 84 holes / 3 holes/day = <<84/3=28>>28 days
Then divide the number of days by the number of days per week to convert the answer to weeks: 28 days / 7 days/week = <<28/7=4>>4 weeks

Math,1a,"Question: Rohan owns a 20-square meter coconut farm. Each square meter has 2 coconut trees and each tree has 6 coconuts. If the coconuts can be harvested every 3 months and each coconut costs $0.50, how much will he earn after 6 months?
Answer: Rohan has a total of 20 x 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 coconut trees.
And he has a total of 40 x 6 = <<40*6=240>>240 coconuts.
So, the total coconut he will have after 6 months is 240 x 2= <<240*2=480>>480.
Therefore, the total amount he will earn is 480 x $0.50 = $<<480*0.5=240>>240.

Question: Ellie takes her little brother down to the pond to teach him how to skip stones. After he takes his first throw, she gives him pointers to improve his technique. His second throw skips two more times across the water than his first. His third throw skips twice as many times as his second. His fourth throw skips 3 fewer times than his third throw. His fifth throw skips one more time than the fourth throw. If his fifth throw skipped 8 times across the water, how many skips did he make in total between all of his throws?
Answer: His fourth throw made 8 - 1 = <<8-1=7>>7 skips.
His third throw made 7 + 3 = <<7+3=10>>10 skips.
His second throw made 10 / 2 = <<10/2=5>>5 skips.
His first throw made 5 - 2 = <<5-2=3>>3 skips.
The total number of skips is 8 + 7 + 10 + 5 + 3 = <<8+7+10+5+3=33>>33 skips.

Question: Nate's dog can dig six holes a day. He digs for 14 days while Nate is on vacation. When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. How many weeks does it take him to fill in all the holes?","Let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate was on vacation: 6 holes/day x 14 days = 84 holes.

Now, let's find out how many holes need to be filled in: 84 holes - 0 holes (since Nate just got back) = 84 holes.

Every day, Nate fills in 9 holes, but the dog digs 6 new holes, so the net holes filled in per day is 9 holes - 6 holes = 3 holes.

Therefore, it will take Nate 84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days to fill in all the holes.

Since there are 7 days in a week, it will take Nate 28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks to fill in all the holes. 

So, Nate will take 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.","First find the number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation: 14 days * 6 holes/day = <<14*6=84>>84 holes
Then find the net number of holes Nate fill in each day: 9 holes/day - 6 holes/day = <<9-6=3>>3 holes/day
Then divide the total number of holes by the daily decrease in the number of holes to find the number of days Nate spends filling in holes: 84 holes / 3 holes/day = <<84/3=28>>28 days
Then divide the number of days by the number of days per week to convert the answer to weeks: 28 days / 7 days/week = <<28/7=4>>4 weeks

Math,1b,"Question: Bernie has a collection of 18 unique postcards. He decided to sell half his collection for $15 per postcard. After he has successfully sold his postcards he decided to spend all the earned money to buy new postcards for $5 each. How many postcards does Bernie have after all his transactions?
Answer: Half of Bernie's collection means 18 * 0.5 = <<18*0.5=9>>9 postcards.
So he was able to sell 9 postcards for 9 * 15 = $<<9*15=135>>135.
He decided to spend all of his money on new postcards for $5 each, so he was able to buy 135 / 5 = 27 new postcards.
This means Bernie has 9 + 27 = <<9+27=36>>36 postcards after all.

Question: Trent caught 180 tadpoles then let 75% of them go. How many did he keep?
Answer: First find the number of tadpoles Trent released: 180 tadpoles * .75 = <<180*.75=135>>135 tadpoles
Then subtract the number he let go from the total number to find the number of tadpoles he keeps: 180 tadpoles - 135 tadpoles = <<180-135=45>>45 tadpoles

Question: Nate's dog can dig six holes a day. He digs for 14 days while Nate is on vacation. When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. How many weeks does it take him to fill in all the holes?","Answer: During the 14 days Nate is on vacation, the dog digs 6 holes/day * 14 days = <<6*14=84>>84 holes.
Since Nate starts filling in 9 holes/day and the dog keeps digging 6 holes/day, the net number of holes filled in each day is 9 holes/day - 6 holes/day = 3 holes/day.
To fill in the remaining holes, Nate needs to fill in 84 holes - 0 holes (since the dog keeps digging) = <<84-0=84>>84 holes.
Therefore, it will take Nate 84 holes / 3 holes/day = <<84/3=28>>28 days to fill in all the holes, or 28 days / 7 days/week = <<28/7=4>>4 weeks.

When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. How many weeks does it take him to fill in all the holes?","Answer: In 14 days, the dog digs a total of 6 holes/day * 14 days = <<6*14=84>>84 holes.
After Nate gets home, the dog's hole digging is offset by Nate's hole filling by 9 holes/day - 6 holes/day = 3 holes/day.
This means that each day, the total number of holes decreases by 3.
Therefore, it will take Nate 84 holes / 3 holes/day = <<84/3=28>>28 days to fill in all the holes.
Since there are 7 days in a week, it will take Nate 28 days / 7 days/week = <<28/7=4>>4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

After Nate gets home, the dog continues to dig 6 new holes/day x 14 days = 84 new holes.
In total, there are 84 + 84 = 168 holes to fill in.
Nate can fill in 9 holes/day, so it will take him 168 holes / 9 holes/day = 18.67 days to fill in all the holes.
Since he can't have a fraction of a day, it will take him 19 days to fill in all the holes.
Therefore, it will take him 19 days / 7 days/week = 2.71 weeks to fill in all the holes.
