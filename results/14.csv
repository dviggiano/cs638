Question: On March 1st the sun sets at 6 PM.  Every day after the sun sets 1.2 minutes later.  It is 6:10 PM and 40 days after March 1st.  How many minutes until the sun sets?
Answer: The sun will set 40*1.2=<<40*1.2=48>>48 minutes later than it does on March 1st.
That means the sun will set at 6:00+48=6:48 PM
So that means the time until sunset is 6:48-6:10=<<648-610=38>>38 minutes

Q: Michael is replacing the carpet in his bedroom.  The new carpet he's chosen costs $12 per square foot, plus $2 per square foot for padding underneath.  His contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet, and $34 per square foot to install the new carpet.  His bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet.  How much will it cost Michael to replace the carpet?","A: 
First, calculate the total area of the bedroom:
Area = length x width
Area = 18 ft x 12 ft
Area = 216 sq ft

Next, calculate the cost of the new carpet:
Cost of carpet = ($12/sq ft + $2/sq ft) x 216 sq ft
Cost of carpet = $14/sq ft x 216 sq ft
Cost of carpet = $3024

Then, calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:
Cost of removing old carpet = $4/sq ft x 216 sq ft
Cost of removing old carpet = $864

Next, calculate the cost of installation:
Cost of installation = $34/sq ft x 216 sq ft
Cost of installation = $7344

Finally, add up all the costs to find the total cost:
Total cost = Cost of carpet + Cost of removing old carpet + Cost of installation
Total cost = $3024 + $864 + $7344
Total cost = $11232

Therefore, it will cost Michael $11,232 to replace the carpet in his bedroom.","The room measures 18 * 12 = <<18*12=216>>216 square feet.
The new carpet costs $12 * 216 = $<<12*216=2592>>2,592.
The new carpet padding costs $2 * 216 = $<<2*216=432>>432.
To remove the old carpet, the contractor will charge $4 * 216 = $<<4*216=864>>864.
To install the new carpet, the contractor will charge $34 * 216 = $<<34*216=7344>>7,344.
The total cost will be $864 + $2,592 + $432 + $7,344 = $11,232.

Math,1a,"Question: Nalani had two female dogs that were expecting and after a month gave birth to 10 puppies each. She then sold 3/4 of the puppies after they came of age, each at $200. Calculate the total amount of money she received from the sale of the puppies.
Answer: If the two expectant dogs gave birth to 10 puppies each, the total number of puppies Nalani had is 10+10= <<10+10=20>>20
When they came of age, Nalani sold 3/4 of the dogs, a total of 3/4*20 = <<3/4*20=15>>15 dogs.
If each dog sold for $200, Nalani received 15*200 = $<<15*200=3000>>3000 from the sale of the dogs.

Question: For her gift present, Lisa has saved $1200. She asks her mother, as well as her brother, to help her raise the total amount of money she needs to buy the gift.,If her mother gave her 3/5 times of what she had saved and her brother gave her twice the amount her mother gave her, calculate the price of the gift she wanted to buy if she still had $400 less.
Answer: Lisa's mother gave her 3/5*$1200 = $<<3/5*1200=720>>720 for her birthday gift.
She also received 2*$720 = $<<2*720=1440>>1440 from her brother for the gift.
If she still had to find $400 to fully reach her birthday gift cost, it means her gift's total cost was $1200+$1440+$720+$400 = $<<1200+1440+720+400=3760>>3760

The cost of the new carpet per square foot is $12 + $2 = $14.

So the cost of the new carpet for the entire room is 216 square feet * $14 = $3024.

The cost to remove the old carpet is 216 square feet * $4 = $864.

The cost to install the new carpet is 216 square feet * $34 = $7344.

Therefore, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet in his bedroom is $3024 + $864 + $7344 = $11232. 

So, it will cost Michael $11,232 to replace the carpet in his bedroom.","The room measures 18 * 12 = <<18*12=216>>216 square feet.

To find the total cost for replacing the carpet, we first calculate the total square footage of the room:

Total square footage = Length x Width
Total square footage = 18 ft x 12 ft
Total square footage = 216 sq ft

Next, we calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding:

Cost of new carpet = Cost per sq ft x Total sq ft
Cost of new carpet = ($12 + $2) x 216
Cost of new carpet = $14 x 216
Cost of new carpet = $3024

Next, we calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:

Cost of removing old carpet = Cost per sq ft x Total sq ft
Cost of removing old carpet = $4 x 216
Cost of removing old carpet = $864

Next, we calculate the cost of installation:

Cost of installation = Cost per sq ft x Total sq ft
Cost of installation = $34 x 216
Cost of installation = $7344

Finally, we add up all the costs:

Total cost = Cost of new carpet + Cost of removing old carpet + Cost of installation
Total cost = $3024 + $864 + $7344
Total cost = $11232

Therefore, it will cost Michael $11,232 to replace the carpet in his bedroom.","The room measures 18 * 12 = <<18*12=216>>216 square feet.

The bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet, so the total square footage is 18 * 12 = 216 square feet.

The cost of the new carpet per square foot is $12, and the padding costs $2 per square foot. So the total cost of the carpet and padding per square foot is $12 + $2 = $14.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, and the total cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot.

To calculate the total cost for replacing the carpet, we need to add the cost of the new carpet and padding, the cost of removing the old carpet, and the cost of installation.

Total cost = (Cost of carpet + padding per square foot * Total square footage) + (Cost of removing old carpet per square foot * Total square footage) + (Cost of installation per square foot * Total square footage) 
Total cost = ($14 * 216) + ($4 * 216) + ($34 * 216)
Total cost = $3024 + $864 + $7344
Total cost = $11368

Therefore, it will cost Michael $11,368 to replace the carpet in his bedroom.","The room measures 18 * 12 = <<18*12=216>>216 square feet.
The new carpet costs $12 * 216 = $<<12*216=2592>>2,592.
The new carpet padding costs $2 * 216 = $<<2*216=432>>432.

To install the new carpet, the contractor will charge $34 * 216 = $<<34*216=7344>>7,344.
