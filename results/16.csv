Math,1a,"Question: Jane runs a small farm.  She has 10 chickens that lay 6 eggs each per week. She can sell the eggs for $2/dozen.  How much money will she make in 2 weeks if she sells all her eggs?
Answer: Jane's chickens lay 10 chickens * 6 eggs = <<10*6=60>>60 eggs per week.
Jane's chickens lay 60 eggs / 12 = <<60/12=5>>5 dozen eggs per week.
Each week that Jane sells her eggs she can make 5 dozen * $2 = $<<5*2=10>>10 per week.
In two weeks Jane would make 2 * $10/week = $<<2*10=20>>20.

Question: John's neighbor tells him to walk his dog for 1 hour each day for a total of $10. He does this for April, save for the 4 Sundays in April. He later spent $50 on books and gave his sister Kaylee the same amount. How much money did John have left?
Answer: April has 30 days, so if he didn't walk the dog on Sundays, he worked for a total of 30 days - 4 days = <<30-4=26>>26 days.
If each day he earned $10, he ends up with 26 days * $10/day = $<<26*10=260>>260 .
After buying books and giving his sister $50, he ends up with $260 - $50 - $50 = $<<260-50-50=160>>160

Q: John picks 4 bananas on Wednesday. Then he picks 6 bananas on Thursday. On Friday, he picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday. How many bananas does John have?","A: John has 4 bananas from Wednesday + 6 bananas from Thursday = <<4+6=10>>10 bananas.
On Friday, John picks 4 bananas * 3 = <<4*3=12>>12 bananas.
Therefore, John has a total of 10 bananas + 12 bananas = <<10+12=22>>22 bananas.","Combining Wednesday and Thursday, John has 4 bananas + 6 bananas = <<4+6=10>>10 bananas.
On Friday, he picks 3 * 4 bananas = <<3*4=12>>12 bananas.
Altogether, John has 10 bananas + 12 bananas = <<10+12=22>>22 bananas.

Math,1a,"Question: A farmer hires small trucks to transport his lemons to the markets. The load on a truck may not be more than 900 kilograms. One bag of lemons has a mass of 8 kilograms. If there are 100 bags of lemons, how many more kilograms can still be loaded into the truck?
Answer: The total weight of 100 bags of lemons is 100 x 8 = <<100*8=800>>800 kilograms.
So, 900 - 800 = <<900-800=100>>100 kilograms can still be loaded into the truck.

Question: The Science museum sells dinosaur models for $100 each. A certain school bought 2 models for the kindergarten library and also bought twice as many for the elementary library. Since the school bought more than 5 models, there was a 5% reduction in price for each model. How much did the school pay in all?
Answer: The school bought 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 dinosaur models for the elementary library.
So the school bought a total of 2 + 4 = <<2+4=6>>6 models.
The price of each model was reduced by $100 x 5/100 = $<<100*5/100=5>>5.
Thus, each model cost $100 - $5 = $<<100-5=95>>95.
Therefore, the school paid a total of $95 x 6 = $<<95*6=570>>570.
