Math,0,"Question: Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls and 300 mini blueberry muffins. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories and a normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. If a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, how many calories do the pastries he baked have?","First, let's calculate the calories in one mini cinnamon roll:
600 calories / 3 = 200 calories

Next, let's calculate the total calories in the mini cinnamon rolls:
200 calories * 200 mini cinnamon rolls = 40,000 calories

Now, let's calculate the calories in one mini blueberry muffin:
450 calories / 3 = 150 calories

Next, let's calculate the total calories in the mini blueberry muffins:
150 calories * 300 mini blueberry muffins = 45,000 calories

Finally, let's calculate the total calories of all the pastries Andrew baked:
40,000 calories + 45,000 calories = 85,000 calories

Therefore, the pastries Andrew baked have a total of 85,000 calories.","First find the number of calories in a mini cinnamon roll: 600 calories / 3 = <<600/3=200>>200 calories
Then multiply that number by the number of mini cinnamon rolls: 200 calories/roll * 200 rolls = <<200*200=40000>>40000 calories
Then find the number of calories in a mini blueberry muffin: 450 calories / 3 = <<450/3=150>>150 calories
Then multiply that number by the number of mini blueberry muffins: 150 calories/muffin * 300 muffins = <<150*300=45000>>45000 calories
Then add the number of calories from each type of pastry to find the total number of calories: 45000 calories + 40000 calories = <<45000+40000=85000>>85000 calories

Math,1a,"Question: A tank with a capacity of 8000 gallons is 3/4 full. Daxton empty's the tank by 40% of the total volume of water in the tank to water his vegetable farm. He then fills the tank with 30% of the volume of water remaining in the tank. Calculate the final volume of water in the tank.
Answer: The volume of water that is in the tank initially is 3/4*8000 = <<3/4*8000=6000>>6000 gallons.
When Daxton empties 40% of the water, he pumps out 40/100*6000 = <<2400=2400>>2400 gallons of water.
The total volume of water remaining in the tank is 6000-2400 = <<6000-2400=3600>>3600 gallons.
Daxton then fills the tank with 30/100*3600 = <<30/100*3600=1080>>1080 gallons of water.
The final volume of water in the tank is 3600+1080 = <<3600+1080=4680>>4680 gallons.

Question: Gilbert grows herbs in his yard to use in his cooking. At the beginning of the spring, he planted three basil bushes, a parsley plant, and two kinds of mint. Halfway through spring, one of the basil plants dropped seeds from a flower and made an extra basil plant grow. However, a rabbit came by the garden near the end of spring and ate all the mint. How many herb plants did Gilbert have when spring ended?
Answer: Gilbert planted 3 + 1 + 2 = <<3+1+2=6>>6 herb plants.
He gained a basil plant when one of the basil plants seeded a new plant, so he had 6 + 1 = <<6+1=7>>7 plants.
The rabbit ate both mint plants, so Gilbert had 7 - 2 = <<7-2=5>>5 herb plants when spring ended.

Question: Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls and 300 mini blueberry muffins. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories and a normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. If a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, how many calories do the pastries he baked have?","Answer: 

The total calories in the mini cinnamon rolls is 200 * 600 * (1/3) = <<200*600*(1/3)=40000>>40000 calories.

The total calories in the mini blueberry muffins is 300 * 450 * (1/3) = <<300*450*(1/3)=45000>>45000 calories.
