Question: The ratio of boys to girls at the dance was 3:4. There were 60 girls at the dance. The teachers were 20% of the number of boys. How many people were at the dance?
Answer: 60 girls represent 4 parts, so one part of students is 60 / 4 = <<60/4=15>>15 students.
There are 15 * 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 boys at the dance.
The teachers at the dance are 45 * 0,2 = 9 teachers at the dance.
There are 60 + 45 + 9 = <<60+45+9=114>>114 people at the dance.

Q: Aiden and 12 of his friends are going to see a film at the cinema, and meet up with 7 more friends there. They each save a seat and then buy enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats. Each seat has enough room to hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks. If drinks and snacks cost $2 each, how much money, in dollars, has the group spent overall on snacks and drinks?","A: Aiden and his 12 friends make a total of 12 + 1 = <<12+1=13>>13 people at the cinema.
Including the extra 7 friends, there are now 13 + 7 = 20 people in total at the cinema.
For each person, they buy 2 drinks and 3 snacks, which cost 2 * $2 + 3 * $2 = $10 per person.
With 20 people in total, they spend $10 * 20 = $<<10*20=200>>200 overall on snacks and drinks. 
Therefore, the group has spent $200 overall on snacks and drinks.","Including Aiden, the whole group saves 1 + 12 + 7 = <<1+12+7=20>>20 seats.
In total, the seats can hold 2 drinks * 20 seats = <<2*20=40>>40 drinks.
In total, the seats can hold 3 snacks * 20 seats = <<3*20=60>>60 snacks.
So in total, the group buys 40 drinks + 60 snacks = <<40+60=100>>100 items.
As snacks and drinks cost $2 each, the group has spent 100 items * $2 = $<<100*2=200>>200 overall.

Math,1a,"Question: James decides to build a tin house by collecting 500 tins in a week. On the first day, he collects 50 tins. On the second day, he manages to collect 3 times that number. On the third day, he collects 50 tins fewer than the number he collected on the second day. If he collects an equal number of tins on the remaining days of the week, what's the number of tins he collected each day for the rest of the week?
Answer: On the second day, he collected 3 times the number of tins he collected on the first day, which is 3*50 = <<3*50=150>>150 tins.
On the third day, he collected 50 tins fewer than the second day, which is 150-50 = <<150-50=100>>100 tins
The total for the three days is 150+100+50 = <<150+100+50=300>>300 tins.
To reach his goal, he still needs 500-300 = <<500-300=200>>200 tins.
Since the total number of days left in the week is 4, he'll need to collect 200/4 = <<200/4=50>>50 tins per day to reach his goal

Question: In the garden, the gecko eats 12 bugs.  The lizard eats half as many bugs as the gecko.  The frog eats 3 times as many bugs as the lizard.  The toad eats 50% more bugs than the frog. How many bugs are eaten in total by all of them?
Answer: Lizard eats 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 bugs.
Frog eats 6 x 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 bugs.
Toad eats 18 x 1.50 = <<18*1.50=27>>27 bugs.
