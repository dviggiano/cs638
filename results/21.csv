Math,1a,"Question: There are 8 loads of laundry that need to be washed. Each load of laundry takes around 45 minutes to complete in the wash cycle and 1 hour in the dry cycle. How long, in hours, will it take to complete the entire set of laundry?
Answer: Each load takes 60 + 45 = <<60+45=105>>105 minutes
There are 8 loads that take 8*105=<<8*105=840>>840 minutes
It takes 840/60=<<840/60=14>>14 hours

Question: It will cost $60 to rent a sailboat and $80 per hour to rent a ski boat. Ken rented a sailboat while Aldrich rented a ski boat. How much more did it cost Aldrich to rent the ski boat than Ken to rent a sailboat for three hours a day in two days?
Answer: Ken paid $60 x 3 = $<<60*3=180>>180 to rent a sailboat for 3 hours in a day
Aldrich paid $80 x 3 = $<<80*3=240>>240 to rent a ski boat in 3 hours in a day.
So Aldrich paid $240 - $180 = $<<240-180=60>>60 more to rent a ski boat than Ken to rent the sailboat each day.
Therefore, it cost Aldrich $60 x 2 = $<<60*2=120>>120 more to rent a ski boat than Ken to rent the sailboat in two days.

Question: Argo has 200 toys. He gives 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 to Bonnie, and 30 to Nicky. How many toys does Argo have now?","Answer: After giving away toys, Argo will have 200 - 40 - 80 - 30 = <<200-40-80-30=50>>50 toys.
Therefore, Argo has 50 toys left.","After Argo gives 40 toys to Alyssa, he remains with 200-40 =<<200-40=160>>160
Argo also gives 80 Bonnie 80 toys and remains with 160-80 = 80 toys
If he also gave Nicky 30 toys, the number of toys Arge remains with is 80-30 = <<80-30=50>>50.

Math,1a,"Question: Melody planted sunflowers from two different seed packets. She found that the sunflowers from Packet A were 20% taller than the sunflowers from Packet B. If the sunflowers from Packet A were 192 inches tall, how tall were the sunflowers from Packet B?
Answer: The height of the sunflowers from Packet A is the same as the height of the sunflowers from Packet B + 20%. If Y represents the height of the sunflowers from Packet B, Y + 0.20Y = the height of sunflowers from Packet A.
We know the height of the sunflowers from Packet A is 192 inches = Y + 0.20Y or 1.2Y.
To figure out Y, we would divide both sides of the equation by 1.2, like this: 192 / 1.2 = 1.2Y / 1.2 or 160 = Y.
