Math,0,"Question: Henry and 3 of his friends order 7 pizzas for lunch. Each pizza is cut into 8 slices. If Henry and his friends want to share the pizzas equally, how many slices can each of them have?","To find out how many slices each of them can have, we first need to determine the total number of slices in 7 pizzas.

7 pizzas * 8 slices per pizza = 56 slices total

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people sharing the pizzas (Henry and his 3 friends).

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person

Therefore, Henry and each of his friends can have 14 slices of pizza each if they want to share the pizzas equally.","There are 7*8=<<7*8=56>>56 slices in total.
There are 1+3=<<1+3=4>>4 people in total.
They can each have 56/4=<<56/4=14>>14 slices.

Math,1a,"Question: TreShaun's full marker has enough ink in it to paint three 4 inch by 4 inch squares. If he colors in two 6 inch by 2 inch rectangles, what percentage of ink is left?
Answer: Each 4 by 4 square equals 16 square inches because 4 x 4 = <<4*4=16>>16
Three squares equals 48 square inches because 3 x 16 = <<48=48>>48
Each rectangle uses 12 square inches because 2 x 6 = <<2*6=12>>12
Both rectangles will use 24 square inches because 2 x 12 = <<2*12=24>>24
He has 1/2 of the ink left because 24 / 48 = 1/2
He has 50% of the ink left because 1/2 x 100 = <<1/2*100=50>>50

Each of them can have 56 / 4 = <<56/4=14>>14 pizza slices each.
Therefore, Henry and each of his friends can have 14 slices of pizza.","There are 7*8=<<7*8=56>>56 slices in total.

Math,1b,"Question: Southton buries their time capsule 15 feet underground. Northton buries their time capsule 12 feet higher than 4 times the depth of the Southton time capsule. How deep is Northton's time capsule buried?
Answer: First multiply the depth of Southton's capsule by 4: 15 feet * 4 = <<15*4=60>>60 feet
Then subtract 12 feet to find the depth of Northton's time capsule: 60 feet - 12 feet = <<60-12=48>>48 feet

Question: Balki is counting the number of raisins in boxes of cereal. He counted 437 total raisins in 5 boxes. In one box he counted 72 raisins. In a second box he counted 74 raisins. The other three boxes had the same number each. How many were in each of the other three boxes?
Answer: Let x = the number of raisins in each of the other 3 boxes. Then 72 + 74 + 3x = 437 raisins
Combining like terms we get 146 + 3x = 437 raisins
Subtracting 146 from both sides we get 3x = 291 raisins
Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 291 / 3 = 97 raisins
