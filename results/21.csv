Math,0,"Question: Johnny's dad brought him to watch some horse racing and his dad bet money. On the first race, he lost $5. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. How much did he lose on average that day?","Let's break down the scenario step by step:

1. Johnny's dad lost $5 on the first race.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost, so he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race, so he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

To calculate the average amount he lost that day, we add up the total amount he lost and divide by the number of races (3): 
Total amount lost = $5 (first race) + $16.50 (third race) = $21.50
Average amount lost = $21.50 / 3 = $7.17

Therefore, Johnny's dad lost an average of $7.17 that day.","On the second race he won $11 because 1+ 5 x 2 = <<1+5*2=11>>11
On the third race he lost $15 because 10 x 1.5 = <<10*1.5=15>>15
He lost a total of $20 on the first and third races because 15 + 5 = <<15+5=20>>20

He lost $9 that day because 11 - 20 = <<11-20=-9>>-9
He lost an average of $3 per race because 9 / 3 = <<9/3=3>>3

Question: Carolyn buys a silverware set with 6 knives, 12 forks, and three times as many spoons as knives. Then her friend trades her 10 knives for 6 spoons. What percentage of Carolyn's silverware is knives?
Answer: First find the final number of knives Carolyn has: 10 knives + 6 knives = <<10+6=16>>16 knives
Then find the initial number of spoons Carolyn has: 6 knives * 3 spoons/knife = <<6*3=18>>18 spoons
Then find the final number of spoons Carolyn has: 18 spoons - 6 spoons = <<18-6=12>>12 spoons
Then find the total final amount of silverware Carolyn has: 12 spoons + 16 knives + 12 forks = <<12+16+12=40>>40 pieces
Then divide the number of knives by the total number of pieces and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 16 knives / 40 pieces * 100% = 40%

Question: Johnny's dad brought him to watch some horse racing and his dad bet money. On the first race, he lost $5. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. How much did he lose on average that day?","To find the total amount Johnny's dad lost, we first need to find how much he won in the second race. 

He won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost, so he won 2*$5 + $1 = $11 in the second race. 

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race, so he lost 1.5*$11 = $16.50 in the third race. 

Therefore, the total amount Johnny's dad lost is $5 + $16.50 = $21.50. 

To find the average amount he lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races, which is $21.50 / 3 = $7.16666666667. 

Therefore, on average, Johnny's dad lost $7.17 that day.","On the second race he won $11 because 1+ 5 x 2 = <<1+5*2=11>>11
On the third race he lost $15 because 10 x 1.5 = <<10*1.5=15>>15
He lost a total of $20 on the first and third races because 15 + 5 = <<15+5=20>>20

He lost $9 that day because 11 - 20 = <<11-20=-9>>-9
He lost an average of $3 per race because 9 / 3 = <<9/3=3>>3

Math,1b,"Question: Today is my birthday and I'm three times older than I was six years ago. What is my age?
Answer: We know that my age divided by three is equal to my age minus six therefore X/3 = X-6 where X = My age
This means that X = 3X - 18 because we can multiply both sides by 3
This also means that -2X=-18 because we can subtract 3X from the right side.
Therefore X = 9 because - 18/-2 = <<-18/-2=9>>9

Question: Tommy's mother lets him ride his bike 2 blocks north of his block, 3 blocks east, 2 blocks west, and 2 blocks south. His friend's father lets his friend ride his bike 80 square blocks. How many times greater is the area his friend can ride in compared to Tommy?
Answer: Tommy's area is 5 blocks wide because 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5
His area is 4 blocks tall because 2 + 2 = <<2+2=4>>4
The total area is 20 square blocks because 5 x 4 = <<5*4=20>>20
His friend's area is 4 times bigger because 80 / 20 = <<80/20=4>>4

Question: Johnny's dad brought him to watch some horse racing and his dad bet money. On the first race, he lost $5. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. How much did he lose on average that day?","Let's denote the amount Johnny's dad lost on the first race as $5. 

He won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost on the second race, so he won $1 + 2($5) = $11 on the second race.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won on the second race, so he lost 1.5($11) = $16.50 on the third race.

Therefore, he lost a total of $5 + $16.50 = $21.50 on all three races.

To find the average amount he lost that day, we divide the total loss by the number of races, so the average is $21.50 / 3 = $7.17.

Therefore, on average, Johnny's dad lost $7.17 that day.","On the second race he won $11 because 1+ 5 x 2 = <<1+5*2=11>>11
On the third race he lost $15 because 10 x 1.5 = <<10*1.5=15>>15
He lost a total of $20 on the first and third races because 15 + 5 = <<15+5=20>>20

He lost $9 that day because 11 - 20 = <<11-20=-9>>-9
He lost an average of $3 per race because 9 / 3 = <<9/3=3>>3

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. How much did he lose on average that day?","To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

First, let's calculate how much Johnny's dad won on the second race: $5 * 2 + $1 = $10 + $1 = $11.

Next, let's calculate how much Johnny's dad lost on the third race: $11 * 1.5 = $16.50.

Now, let's calculate the total amount Johnny's dad lost that day: $5 (first race) + $11 (second race) + $16.50 (third race) = $32.50.

Since there were a total of 3 races, let's divide the total amount lost by 3 to find the average: $32.50 / 3 = $10.83 (rounded to the nearest cent).

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. How much did he lose on average that day?","To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount lost and divide it by the number of races.

- In the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.
- In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost, which is $1 + 2($5) = $11. So, he lost in the second race $11 - $5 = $6.
- In the third race, he lost 1.5 times the amount he won in the second race, which is 1.5($6) = $9.

To find out the total amount lost, we add all the amounts: $5 (first race) + $6 (second race) + $9 (third race) = $20.

Since there were three races, to find the average amount lost, we divide the total amount lost by 3: $20 / 3 = $6.67 (rounded to two decimal places).

Therefore, Johnny's dad lost an average of $6.67 that day.","On the second race he won $11 because 1+ 5 x 2 = <<1+5*2=11>>11
