Math,0,"Question: Two friends are playing pick-up sticks. While playing, they noticed that there are 9 red sticks, and 5 more blue sticks than red. Also, the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks. How many sticks do they have?","Let's start by defining the number of red sticks as ""R"".

We are given that there are 9 red sticks, so R = 9.

Given that there are 5 more blue sticks than red, the number of blue sticks (B) can be expressed as B = R + 5.

Substituting the value of R into this equation, we get B = 9 + 5 = 14.

Next, we are told that the number of yellow sticks (Y) is 3 less than the blue sticks. This can be expressed as Y = B - 3.

Substituting the value of B into this equation, we get Y = 14 - 3 = 11.

Finally, to find the total number of sticks, we simply add up the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks:

Total = R + B + Y
Total = 9 + 14 + 11
Total = 34 sticks

Therefore, the two friends have a total of 34 sticks.","There are 9 + 5 = <<9+5=14>>14 blue sticks.
There are 14 - 3 = <<14-3=11>>11 yellow sticks.
There are a total of 9 + 14 + 11 = <<9+14+11=34>>34 sticks.

Answer: Farrah ordered 4 boxes from Amazon containing 20 matchboxes each, a total of 4*20=<<4*20=80>>80 matchboxes.

Question: My mother celebrated her birthday with a total of 60 guests. Half of the guests are women, 15 are men, and the rest are children. In the middle of the celebration, 1/3 of the men and 5 children left. How many people stayed and enjoyed the birthday celebration?
Answer: There were 60 guests / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 women at my mother's birthday celebration.
There were 30 women + 15 men = <<30+15=45>>45 men and women.
So, 60 people - 45 men and women = <<60-45=15>>15 were children.
Then, 15 men / 3 = <<15/3=5>>5 men left.
Thus, 5 men + 5 children = 10 people left.
Therefore, 60 people - 10 people = <<60-10=50>>50 people stayed and enjoyed the birthday celebration.

Question: Two friends are playing pick-up sticks. While playing, they noticed that there are 9 red sticks, and 5 more blue sticks than red. Also, the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks. How many sticks do they have?","Let's denote the number of red sticks as R.

Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, the number of blue sticks is R + 5.

And since the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, the number of yellow sticks is R + 5 - 3.

Therefore, the total number of sticks is R (red) + R + 5 (blue) + R + 5 - 3 (yellow) = 3R + 7.

Since there are 9 red sticks, we can substitute R = 9 into the equation.

So, the total number of sticks is 3(9) + 7 = 27 + 7 = <<3*9+7=34>>34 sticks. 

Therefore, they have a total of 34 sticks.","There are 9 + 5 = <<9+5=14>>14 blue sticks.
There are 14 - 3 = <<14-3=11>>11 yellow sticks.
There are a total of 9 + 14 + 11 = <<9+14+11=34>>34 sticks.

Answer: Ethan read a total of 40 pages + 10 pages = <<40+10=50>>50 pages on Saturday.
On the next day, he read a total of 50 pages x 2 = <<50*2=100>>100 pages.
The total number of pages that Ethan had read is 50 pages + 100 pages = <<50+100=150>>150 pages.

Question: Two friends are playing pick-up sticks. While playing, they noticed that there are 9 red sticks, and 5 more blue sticks than red. Also, the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks. How many sticks do they have?","Answer: Let x be the number of red sticks.

There are 9 red sticks, so x = 9.

There are 5 more blue sticks than red, so the number of blue sticks is x + 5.

There are 3 less yellow sticks than blue, so the number of yellow sticks is x + 5 - 3.

Therefore, the total number of sticks is x + (x + 5) + (x + 5 - 3) = 3x + 7.

Substitute x = 9 into the equation to get 3(9) + 7 = 27 + 7 = 34.

Therefore, they have a total of 34 sticks.","There are 9 + 5 = <<9+5=14>>14 blue sticks.

Question: Two friends are playing pick-up sticks. While playing, they noticed that there are 9 red sticks, and 5 more blue sticks than red. Also, the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks. How many sticks do they have?","Let's denote the number of red sticks as R.

The number of blue sticks is 5 more than the red sticks: B = R + 5.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks: Y = B - 3 = (R + 5) - 3 = R + 2.

The total number of sticks they have is the sum of red, blue, and yellow sticks: Total = R + B + Y = R + (R + 5) + (R + 2) = 3R + 7.

Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red, the number of blue sticks is R + 5.

The total number of sticks is R + (R + 5) + ((R + 5) - 3) = 9R + 7.
