Math,1a,"Question: A car traveled 360 miles in 4 hours and 30 minutes. What was its speed in miles per hour?
Answer: There are 60 minutes in one hour, so the car traveled 360 miles in 4 hours + 30 minutes/60 minutes/hour = 4.5 hours.
In one hour, the car travels 360 miles / 4.5 hours = <<360/4.5=80>>80 miles/hour.

Question: Last year, Jorge planted corn on all of his 60 acres of property.  Typically, corn grown on good soil yields 400 bushels per acre, but in clay-rich soil, the yield is only half as much per acre as in good soil.  One-third of Jorge's 60 acres of land is clay-rich soil and the rest is good soil.  How many bushels of corn did Jorge's land yield last year?
Answer: Jorge has 60 * (1/3) = <<60*(1/3)=20>>20 acres of clay-rich soil.
He has 60 - 20 = <<60-20=40>>40 acres of good soil.
At 400 bushels per acre, his 40 acres of good soil produced 40 * 400 = <<400*40=16000>>16,000 bushels of corn.
If good soil produces 400 bushels per acre, clay-rich soil produces 400 / 2 = <<400/2=200>>200 bushels per acre.
At 200 bushels per acre, his 20 acres of clay-rich soil produced 20 * 200 = <<200*20=4000>>4,000 bushels of corn.
Altogether, his land produced 16,000 + 4,000 = <<16000+4000=20000>>20,000 bushels of corn.

Q: A shoe store was having a weekend sale on a brand of popular tennis shoes. On Friday the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. The next day they sold double that number of shoes. On the last day of the sale they sold one-half the amount that they did the day before, but six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit. How many tennis shoes were sold by the end of the sale?","A: The store sold 14 * 2 = <<14*2=28>>28 pairs of tennis shoes on Saturday.
On Sunday, they sold 28 / 2 = <<28/2=14>>14 pairs of tennis shoes.
After the returns, they sold a total of 14 + 28 + 14 - 6 = <<14+28+14-6=50>>50 pairs of tennis shoes by the end of the sale. 
Therefore, the store sold 50 pairs of tennis shoes by the end of the sale.","On Saturday 14*2=<<14*2=28>>28 shoes were sold

Math,1a,"Question: Brian is taping up some boxes. Each box needs three pieces of tape, one as long as the long side and two as long as the short side. If Brian tapes up 5 boxes that measure 15 inches by 30 inches and 2 boxes that measure 40 inches square, how much tape does he need?
Answer: First find the amount of tape each 15 in x 30 in box needs on the short sides: 2 sides * 15 inches/side = <<2*15=30>>30 inches
Then add that to the amount of tape each 15 in x 30 in box needs on the long side to find the total amount needed per box: 30 inches + 30 inches = <<30+30=60>>60 inches
Then multiply that amount by 5 boxes to find the total amount needed: 60 inches/box * 5 boxes = 300 inches
Then find the amount of tape each 40 in x 40 in box needs for its three equal length sides: 3 sides * 40 inches/side = <<3*40=120>>120 inches
Then multiply that amount by 2 boxes to find the total amount needed: 120 inches/box * 2 boxes = 240 inches
Then add the total amount needed for each box size to find the grand total: 240 inches + 300 inches = <<240+300=540>>540 inches

Answer: The nuts are $25.00 and he has a $5.00 coupon, so the nuts are on sale for $25-$5 = $<<25-5=20.00>>20.00
He eats 1 oz of nuts every evening and the bag has 40 oz of nuts, so it has 40/1 = <<40/1=40>>40 1 oz servings
