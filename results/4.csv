Math,0,Question: Dylan needed chicken sausages and fish sausages to make sausage buns at a party. He bought 38 chicken sausages and 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. How many sausages did Dylan buy in all?,"Let's denote the number of chicken sausages Dylan bought as C. According to the given information, he bought 38 chicken sausages, so C = 38.

Since he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, the number of fish sausages he bought is C + 6 = 38 + 6 = 44.

Therefore, the total number of sausages Dylan bought is:
38 (chicken sausages) + 44 (fish sausages) = 38 + 44 = 82

Dylan bought a total of 82 sausages.","He bought 38 + 6 = <<38+6=44>>44 fish sausages.
Dylan bought 38 + 44 = <<38+44=82>>82 sausages in all.

Math,1a,"Question: Eddie is 92 years old. His granddaughter Becky is currently four times younger than he is. The mother of Becky - Irene, is two times her age. How old is Irene?
Answer: Becky is four times younger than Eddie, which means she is 92 / 4 = <<92/4=23>>23 years old.
Her mother is two times older than she, so it means Irene is 23 * 2 = <<23*2=46>>46 years old.

Question: James gets paid $0.50/mile to drive a truck carrying hazardous waste. He has to pay $4.00/gallon for gas and his truck gets 20 miles per gallon. How much profit does he make from a 600 mile trip?
Answer: First find the total payment James receives: $0.50/mile * 600 miles = $<<0.50*600=300>>300
Then find how many gallons of gas he needs to buy: 600 miles / 20 miles/gallon = <<600/20=30>>30 gallons
Then multiply that number by the price of gas per gallon to find the total cost of the gas: $4.00/gallon * 30 gallons = $<<4*30=120>>120
Then subtract that amount from James' earnings to find his profit: $300 - $120 = $<<300-120=180>>180

Math,1b,"Question: Gnuff charges a flat rate of $20 per tutoring session plus $7 per minute. The total amount paid for Gnuff for tutoring for one session is $146. How many minutes did Gnuff tutor for?
Answer: First find the amount paid just for the per-minute fee, which is $146 - $20 = $<<146-20=126>>126.

Question: Daisy is climbing trees all around her neighborhood and starts to notice the number of branches and the height. The first tree she climbs is 50 feet tall and has 200 branches. The second tree she climbs is 40 feet tall and has 180 branches. The third tree she climbs is 60 feet tall and has 180 branches. The final tree she climbs is 34 feet tall and has 153 branches. On average, how many branches do these trees have per foot?
Answer: The first tree has 4 branches per foot because 200 / 50 = <<200/50=4>>4
The second tree tree has 4.5 branches per foot because 180 / 40 = <<180/40=4.5>>4.5
