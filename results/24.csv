Math,1a,"Question: Tom decides to get a new floor for his room.  It cost $50 to remove the floor.  The new floor costs $1.25 per square foot and Tom's room is 8*7 feet.  How much did it cost to replace the floor?
Answer: The room is 8*7=<<8*7=56>>56 square feet
So the new carpet cost 56*1.25=$<<56*1.25=70>>70
So the total cost was 50+70=$<<50+70=120>>120

Question: Bridgette has 2 dogs, 3 cats, and 4 birds. She gives the dogs a bath twice a month. She gives the cats a bath once a month. She gives the birds a bath once every 4 months. In a year, how many baths does she give?
Answer: Each dog gets 24 baths a year because 2 x 12 = <<2*12=24>>24
Each cat gets 12 baths a year because 1 x 12 = <<1*12=12>>12
Each bird averages .25 baths per month because 1 / 4 = <<1/4=.25>>.25
Each bird gets 3 baths a year because .25 x 12 = <<.25*12=3>>3
She gives 48 dog baths because 2 x 24 = <<2*24=48>>48
She gives 72 cat baths because 3 x 12 = 36
She gives 12 bird baths a year because 4 x 3 = <<4*3=12>>12
She gives 132 baths a year because 48 + 36+ 12 = <<48+36+12=96>>96

Q: A pirate crew is digging for buried treasure on the island marked X on a map. They dug ten holes the first day, thirteen holes the second day, and eight holes the third day. They stopped digging early on the third day to fill in two holes the pirates kept falling in. On the fourth day of digging, they unearthed a treasure chest full of gold, jewels, and an aged hat. The island had four times as many holes by then as it did at the end of the first day. How many holes did the pirates dig on the fourth day before finding the treasure?","A total of 10 + 13 + 8 = <<10+13+8=31>>31 holes were dug in the first three days.
After filling in two holes, there were 31 - 2 = 29 holes remaining.
At the end of the fourth day, there were 4 * 10 = <<4*10=40>>40 holes dug in total.
Therefore, 40 - 29 = <<40-29=11>>11 holes were dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure.","Let X mark the number of holes they dug on the fourth day.
The island had 4 * 10 = <<4*10=40>>40 holes when they found the treasure.
They dug 10 + 13 + 8 = <<10+13+8=31>>31 holes the first three days.
After filling in 2 holes, they had 31 - 2 = <<31-2=29>>29 holes dug.
When they found the treasure, they had 29 + X = 40 holes dug.
Thus, the pirates dug 40 - 29 = <<40-29=11>>11 holes on the fourth day.

Question: For every loaf of bread that Ted buys, he needs an additional 2 packs of sandwich meat and 2 packs of sliced cheese to make 10 sandwiches.  The bread costs $4.00, the sandwich meat costs $5.00 per pack and the cheese costs $4.00 per pack.  He has a $1.00 off  coupon for one pack of cheese and an additional $1.00 coupon for one pack of meat.  How much does each sandwich cost?
Answer: He buys 2 packs of sandwich meat at $5.00 a pack so 2*5.00 = $<<2*5=10.00>>10.00
He buys 2 packs of cheese at $4.00 a pack so 2*4.00 = $<<2*4=8.00>>8.00
The loaf of bread cost $4.00 plus $10.00 for meat and $8.00 for cheese so his total is 4+10+8 = $<<4+10+8=22.00>>22.00
He has coupons to use a checkout so his new total is 22-1-1 = $<<22-1-1=20.00>>20.00
He can make 10 sandwiches from his purchase and his purchase total is $20 so 20/10 = $<<20/10=2.00>>2.00
