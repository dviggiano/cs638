Math,0,"Question: In a certain school, two classes have a total of 80 students. Each class has the same amount of students, and in each class 40% of the students are girls. How many boys are in each class?","In each class, 60% of the students are boys (100% - 40% = 60%).

If two classes have a total of 80 students, then each class has 80/2 = 40 students.

If 40% of each class is girls, then there are 40 * 0.4 = 16 girls in each class.

Therefore, in each class, there are 40 - 16 = 24 boys. 

So, there are 24 boys in each class.","If both classes have the same amount of students, that means each of them has 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 students.
The girls in each class make up to 40%, so there are 40/100 * 40 = <<40/100*40=16>>16 girls in each of them.
That means the rest of the class are boys, so there are 40 - 16 = <<40-16=24>>24 boys in each class.

Question: Margaux owns a money lending company. Her friend pays her $5 per day, her brother $8 per day, and her cousin $4 per day. How much money will she collect after 7 days?
Answer: Her friend will pay $5 x 7 = $<<5*7=35>>35 after 7 days.
Her brother will pay $8 x 7 = $<<8*7=56>>56 after 7 days.
Her cousin will pay $4 x 7 = $<<4*7=28>>28 after 7 days.

Question: In a certain school, two classes have a total of 80 students. Each class has the same amount of students, and in each class 40% of the students are girls. How many boys are in each class?","Let's denote the number of boys in each class as B. Since each class has the same number of students, each class will have 80/2 = 40 students.

If 40% of the students in each class are girls, then 60% are boys. Since boys make up 60% of each class, we can set up the following equation to find the number of boys in each class:

0.60 * 40 = B

24 = B

Therefore, there are 24 boys in each class.","If both classes have the same amount of students, that means each of them has 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 students.
