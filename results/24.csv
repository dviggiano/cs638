Math,0,Question: There are 100 plants in Mrs. Smith's garden. One-fourth of her plants are indoor plants. Two-thirds of the remaining are outdoor plants while the rest are flowering plants. What percent of the plants are flowering plants?,"To find out what percent of the plants are flowering plants, we first need to calculate the number of indoor and outdoor plants.

Number of indoor plants = 1/4 * 100 = 25 plants
Number of remaining plants = 100 - 25 = 75 plants

Number of outdoor plants = 2/3 * 75 = 50 plants
Number of flowering plants = 75 - 50 = 25 plants

Percent of flowering plants = (25/100) * 100 = 25%

Therefore, 25% of the plants in Mrs. Smith's garden are flowering plants.","There are 100 x 1/4 = <<100*1/4=25>>25 indoor plants.
So, 100 - 25 = <<100-25=75>>75 plants are not indoor plants.
There are 75 x 2/3 = <<75*2/3=50>>50 outdoor plants.
And 75 - 50 = <<75-50=25>>25 flowering plants.
Thus, 25/100 x 100% = 25% of the plants are flowering plants.

Math,1a,"Question: Each dandelion produces 300 seeds. 1/3rd of the seeds land in water and die. 1/6 of the starting number are eaten by insects. Half the remainder sprout and are immediately eaten. How many dandelions survive long enough to flower?
Answer: First find the number of seeds that land in water: 300 seeds * 1/3 = <<300*1/3=100>>100 seeds
Then find the number of seeds that are eaten: 300 seeds * 1/6 = <<300*1/6=50>>50 seeds
Subtract the number of seeds that are destroyed to find the number that sprout: 300 seeds - 100 seeds - 50 seeds = <<300-100-50=150>>150 seeds
Then divide that number by 2 to find the number of sprouts that survive: 150 seeds / 2 = <<150/2=75>>75 seeds
#### 75
Question: Carla has 6 sunflowers and 8 dandelions. The sunflowers have 9 seeds per plant and the dandelions have 12 seeds per plant. What percentage of Carla's seeds come from the dandelions?
Answer: First calculate the number of seeds from the sunflowers by multiplying the number of sunflowers by the number of seeds per sunflower: 6 sunflowers * 9 seeds/sunflower = <<6*9=54>>54 seeds
Next calculate the number of seeds from the dandelions by multiplying the number of dandelions by the number of seeds per dandelion: 8 dandelions * 12 seeds/dandelion = <<8*12=96>>96 seeds
Now add the number of seeds from each group of plants to find the total number of seeds: 54 seeds + 96 seeds = <<54+96=150>>150 seeds
Now divide the number of dandelion seeds by the total number of seeds and multiply the answer by 100 to find the percentage of seeds that come from the dandelions: 96 seeds / 150 seeds * 100% = 64%

Question: There are 100 plants in Mrs. Smith's garden. One-fourth of her plants are indoor plants. Two-thirds of the remaining are outdoor plants while the rest are flowering plants. What percent of the plants are flowering plants?","Answer: First, calculate the number of indoor plants by dividing the total number of plants by 4: 100 plants / 4 = 25 indoor plants
Next, subtract the number of indoor plants from the total to find the number of outdoor plants: 100 plants - 25 indoor plants = 75 outdoor plants
Then, find two-thirds of the outdoor plants by multiplying the number of outdoor plants by 2/3: 75 outdoor plants * 2/3 = 50 outdoor plants
Finally, subtract the number of outdoor plants from the total number of plants to find the number of flowering plants: 100 plants - 25 indoor plants - 50 outdoor plants = 25 flowering plants
Calculate the percentage of flowering plants by dividing the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiplying by 100: 25 flowering plants / 100 total plants * 100% = 25% 
Therefore, 25% of Mrs. Smith's plants are flowering plants.","There are 100 x 1/4 = <<100*1/4=25>>25 indoor plants.
So, 100 - 25 = <<100-25=75>>75 plants are not indoor plants.
There are 75 x 2/3 = <<75*2/3=50>>50 outdoor plants.
And 75 - 50 = <<75-50=25>>25 flowering plants.
Thus, 25/100 x 100% = 25% of the plants are flowering plants.

Math,1b,"Question: Peter and Andrew like to run in the morning.  Peter runs 3 miles more than Andrew's 2 miles.  After 5 days, how many miles have they both run?
Answer: Peter runs 3 miles more than Andrew's 2 miles, so he runs 3+2 = <<3+2=5>>5 miles
Peter runs 5 miles a day and Andrew runs 2 miles so they run 5+2 = <<5+2=7>>7 miles a day
If they run 7 miles a day then over a course of 5 days they run 7*5 = <<7*5=35>>35 miles

Question: There are 100 plants in Mrs. Smith's garden. One-fourth of her plants are indoor plants. Two-thirds of the remaining are outdoor plants while the rest are flowering plants. What percent of the plants are flowering plants?","Answer: One-fourth of 100 plants is 100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25 indoor plants.
The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = <<100-25=75>>75 plants.
Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants, so 75 x 2/3 = <<75*2/3=50>>50 outdoor plants.
The rest of the plants, which are flowering plants, are 75 - 50 = <<75-50=25>>25.
Therefore, 25 out of 100 plants are flowering plants, making it 25%.","There are 100 x 1/4 = <<100*1/4=25>>25 indoor plants.
So, 100 - 25 = <<100-25=75>>75 plants are not indoor plants.
There are 75 x 2/3 = <<75*2/3=50>>50 outdoor plants.
And 75 - 50 = <<75-50=25>>25 flowering plants.
Thus, 25/100 x 100% = 25% of the plants are flowering plants.

Question: Carla has 6 sunflowers and 8 dandelions. The sunflowers have 9 seeds per plant and the dandelions have 12 seeds per plant. What percentage of Carla's seeds come from the dandelions?
Answer: First calculate the number of seeds from the sunflowers by multiplying the number of sunflowers by the number of seeds per sunflower: 6 sunflowers * 9 seeds/sunflower = <<6*9=54>>54 seeds
Next calculate the number of seeds from the dandelions by multiplying the number of dandelions by the number of seeds per dandelion: 8 dandelions * 12 seeds/dandelion = <<8*12=96>>96 seeds
Now add the number of seeds from each group of plants to find the total number of seeds: 54 seeds + 96 seeds = <<54+96=150>>150 seeds
Now divide the number of dandelion seeds by the total number of seeds and multiply the answer by 100 to find the percentage of seeds that come from the dandelions: 96 seeds / 150 seeds * 100% = 64%

Then subtract the indoor plants to find the number of outdoor plants: 100 plants - 25 plants = <<100-25=75>>75 plants
Now find what fraction of the total plants are outdoor plants: 75 plants / 100 plants = 3/4
Subtract this fraction from 1 to find the fraction that are flowering plants: 1 - 3/4 = 1/4

The remaining number of plants after the indoor plants are taken out is 100-25 = <<100-25=75>>75 plants.
Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants, so 2/3 of 75 = <<2/3*75=50>>50 plants are outdoor plants.
The number of flowering plants is 75-50 = <<75-50=25>>25 plants.
