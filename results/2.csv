Math,1a,"A: Monic has 40 - 4 = <<40-4=36>>36 crabs
Rani has 36 + 10 = <<36+10=46>>46 crabs
Together, they have 40 + 36 + 46 = <<40+36+46=122>>122 crabs. 
Therefore, the total number of crabs the three have together is 122.","If Bo has 40 crabs, then Monic, who has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, has 40-4 = <<40-4=36>>36 crabs.
Bo and Monic have a total of 36+40 = <<36+40=76>>76 crabs.
Since Monic has 36 crabs, Rani's number of crabs is 36+ 10 = <<36+10=46>>46.
Together, the three have 76+46 = <<76+46=122>>122 crabs.

Math,2,"A: If Bo has 40 crabs, then Monic has 40-4 = 36 crabs.
Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36+10 = 46 crabs.

Math,3b,"A: If Bo has 40 crabs, and Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, then Monic has 40 crabs - 4 crabs = 36 crabs.
Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 crabs + 10 crabs = 46 crabs.
Together, they have 40 crabs (Bo) + 36 crabs (Monic) + 46 crabs (Rani) = 122 crabs.
