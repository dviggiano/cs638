Math,1a,"Q: Jason spent 1/4 of his money and an additional $10 on some books. He then spent 2/5 of the remaining money and an additional $8 on some DVDs. If he was left with $130, how much money did he have at first?
A: Let X be the money Jason had at first.
Jason spent 1/4*X + 10 on books.
Jason spent 2/5*[X - (1/4*X + 10)] + 8 on some DVDs.
Jason has X - (1/4*X + 10) - {2/5*[X - (1/4*X + 10)] + 8} = $130 left.
X - 1/4*X - 10 - 2/5*X + 1/10*X + 4 - 8 = $130.
9/20*X - 14 = $130.
X = $<<320=320>>320.

Q: Three baskets A, B and C contain different numbers of differently colored marbles. Basket A contains 4 red marbles and 2 yellow marbles. Basket B contains 6 green marbles and 1 yellow marble. Basket C contains 3 white marbles and 9 yellow marbles. What is the difference between the number of each color of marble in the basket that has the greatest difference?
A: In basket A the number difference between differently colored marbles is 4-2 = <<4-2=2>>2
In basket B the difference is 6-1 = <<6-1=5>>5
In basket C the difference is 9-3 = <<9-3=6>>6

Q: If Alice purchased 3600 acorns for nine times the price Bob paid, and Bob paid $6000 for his acorns, how much money did Alice pay for each acorn?
A: Nine times the price Bob paid for his acorns is 9*$6000 = $<<9*6000=54000>>54000
If Alice purchased 3600 acorns for nine times the price Bob paid, she paid $54000/3600 = $15 for each acorn.

Q: Jenny makes and freezes pans of lasagna all week so she can sell them at the market on the weekend.  It costs Jenny $10.00 in ingredients to make 1 pan of lasagna.  If she makes and sells 20 pans over the weekend at $25.00 apiece, how much does she make after factoring in expenses?
A: Each pan costs $10.00 to make so for 20 pans, it will cost 10*20 = $<<10*20=200.00>>200.00
She sells each of the 20 pans for $25.00 each so she will make 20*25 = $<<20*25=500.00>>500.00
She makes $500.00 and spent $200.00 on ingredients so she makes 500-200 = $<<500-200=300.00>>300.00

Q: Tamia is making dinner. She is using 5 bell peppers to make her meal. She likes to have a variety of sizes so some will melt and some will be thick enough to eat whole. First she cuts each bell pepper into 20 large slices. Then she takes half those slices and cuts them into 3 smaller pieces each. How many slices and pieces of bell pepper total is Tamia going to add to her meal?
A: First, Tamia cuts the 5 bell peppers into 20 slices each, 5 x 20 = <<5*20=100>>100 slices.
Then, she takes 1/2 of those to cut into smaller pieces, 100 / 2 = <<100/2=50>>50 slices to cut smaller.
Tamia takes each of those 50 slices and cuts them into 3 pieces each, 50 x 3 = <<50*3=150>>150.
Tamia is adding 50 slices + 150 smaller pieces = <<50+150=200>>200 pieces of bell pepper added to her meal.

Q: Ross takes 17 breaths per minute by inhaling 5/9 liter of air to his lungs. What is the volume of air inhaled in 24 hours?
A: We have 60 minutes per hour.
So, in 24 hours we have 60 * 24 = <<60*24=1440>>1440 minutes.
So, the volume of air Ross inhaled in 24 hours is: 17 breaths/minute * 5/9 L/breath * 1440 minutes = 122400 / 9 = <<17*5/9*1440=13600>>13600 liters.
The volume of air inhaled is 13600 liters.

Q: An organization trying to save endangered species of turtles has taken twice more hawksbill turtles than the number of green turtles into a conservation center. If the number of green turtles is 800, calculate the number of turtles that have been taken into the conservation center.
A: If the number of hawksbill turtles is twice more than the number of green turtles, then there are 2*800 = <<2*800=1600>>1600 more hawksbill turtles.
The total number of hawksbill turtles is 800+1600 = <<800+1600=2400>>2400
The total number of turtles that have been taken into the conservation center is 2400+800 = <<2400+800=3200>>3200 turtles.
