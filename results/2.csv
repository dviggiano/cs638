Question: Mrs. Gable’s third grade class is on a field trip to the beach. For lunch, Mrs. Gable brought 20 lunches for the 20 students in her class. She included a pack of animal crackers in each lunch bag for dessert. Each pack of animal crackers contained 10 animal crackers. If 2 students did not eat their animal crackers, how many animal crackers were eaten in total among Mrs. Gable’s students?
Answer: Since 2 students did not eat their animal crackers, 20 - 2 = <<20-2=18>>18 students ate their animal crackers.
The students ate a total of 18 * 10 =<<18*10=180>>180 animal crackers

Q: Suzie loves to chew fruit-flavored gum. She bought four packs of gum the last time she was at the store. She got two packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. If she paid $7 in all, how many dollars did each pack of strawberry gum cost?","Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as x.

Since she bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, the total cost for them would be 2x.

She bought 1 pack of grape gum for $2, and 1 pack of green apple gum for $1 (half the price of the grape gum).

So, the total cost of all the gum she bought is 2x + $2 + $1 = $7.

This can be written as:
2x + 2 + 1 = 7
2x + 3 = 7
2x = 7 - 3
2x = 4
x = 4 / 2
x = 2

Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.
#### Each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.","The green apple gum cost half as much as the $2 grape gum, so it cost 2 / 2 = $<<2/2=1>>1.
Thus, the two packs of strawberry gum cost 7 - 2 - 1 = $<<7-2-1=4>>4.
Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum cost 4 / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.

Math,1a,"Question: Bryan bought three different bottles of milk. The bottles contain the following volumes of milk: 2 liters, 750 milliliters, 250 milliliters. How many liters of milk did Bryan buy in total?
Answer: Bryan bought a total of 750 + 250 = <<750+250=1000>>1000 milliliters of milk from the two smaller bottles.
Since 1 liter is equal to 1000 milliliters, then 1000 milliliters is equal to 1000/1000 = <<1000/1000=1>>1 liter.
Therefore, Bryan bought a total of 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 liters of milk.

Suzie bought 2 packs of her favorite flavor, so she spent 2*x dollars on those.

She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum and half as much for a pack of green apple gum, which means she paid $1 for the green apple gum.

In total, she spent 2*x + $2 + $1 = $7.

Combining like terms, we get 2*x + $3 = $7.

Subtracting $3 from both sides, we get 2*x = $4.

Dividing by 2, we find x = $2.

Each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.","The green apple gum cost half as much as the $2 grape gum, so it cost 2 / 2 = $<<2/2=1>>1.

Since she bought two packs of strawberry gum, the total cost for strawberry gum is 2*x = 2x.
She paid $2 for the pack of grape gum and half as much for a small pack of green apple gum, so the cost of the green apple gum is $2/2 = $1.
Therefore, the total cost of all the gum is 2x + $2 + $1 = 2x + $3.
Since she paid $7 in all, we can set up the equation 2x + $3 = $7.
Subtracting $3 from both sides gives 2x = $4.
Dividing both sides by 2 gives x = $2.
Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.","The green apple gum cost half as much as the $2 grape gum, so it cost 2 / 2 = $<<2/2=1>>1.
