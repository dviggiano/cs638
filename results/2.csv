Math,0,"Question: To make 1 liter of juice, Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges. Each kilogram of oranges costs $3. How much money would Sam have to spend to make 4 liters of juice?","To make 1 liter of juice, Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges at $3 per kilogram. Therefore, the cost of oranges for 1 liter of juice is 5 kg * $3/kg = $15.

To make 4 liters of juice, Sam would need 4 * $15 = $60 worth of oranges. 

Therefore, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.","To make 4 liters of juice, Sam needs 4 * 5 = <<4*5=20>>20 kilograms of oranges.
If one kilogram of oranges costs $3, then 20 kilograms would cost 20 * 3 = $<<20*3=60>>60.

Math,1a,"Question: Bob is building a vegetable garden. It is 220 feet long by 120 feet wide. Half of the garden is going to be tilled land. A third of the rest of it will have trellises for vining plants, and the rest will be devoted to raised beds. How big will the raised bed section of the garden be?
Answer: The garden is 220 * 120 = <<220*120=26400>>26,400 square feet.
The tilled land will take up half the area, and the trellises and raised beds will be the other half. Each half is 26,400 / 2 = <<26400/2=13200>>13,200 square feet.
The trellises will take up 1/3 of the remaining land, so the raised beds will take 1 - 1/3 = 2/3 of the remaining land.
So the total area of the raised bed area will be 13,200 square feet * (2 / 3) = <<13200*(2/3)=8800>>8,800 square feet.

Question: The cost of filling a car fuel tank is $45, and this can take you 500 miles before refilling. Mallory was going to her grammy's house, 2000 miles away. If she used 3/5 times as much money on food as she spent on filling the car fuel tank for the whole journey, calculate the total amount of money she used.
Answer: If Mallory gammy's house is 2000 miles away and she has to refill the fuel tank every 500 miles, she filled the tank 2000/500 = <<2000/500=4>>4 times.
If each refill costs $45, the total amount of money she used on refilling the tank is $45*4 = $<<45*4=180>>180
The food cost was 3/5 times as much as the fuel costs, which is 3/5*$180 = $<<3/5*180=108>>108
On the whole journey, Mallory expenses on fuel and food costs are $108+$180 = $<<108+180=288>>288
