Math,0,"Question: Michael is traveling on the interstate at an average speed of 50km/hr (taking into account all the necessary stops for gas, relaxation, etc.). If he goes on like this for 3 days, and the distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km, what percentage of this distance has he covered?","First, let's calculate how far Michael travels in 3 days:

Speed = 50 km/hr
Time = 3 days = 3 days x 24 hours/day = 72 hours

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 50 km/hr x 72 hr
Distance = 3600 km

Now, let's calculate the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered:

Percentage Covered = (Distance Covered / Total Distance) x 100%
Percentage Covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) x 100%
Percentage Covered = 0.60 x 100%
Percentage Covered = 60%

Therefore, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas in 3 days.","There are 24 hours in each day, so he has been traveling for a total of 3*24 = <<24*3=72>>72 hours
At a rate of 50km/hr he has covered 50*72 = <<50*72=3600>>3600 km
3600km as a percentage of 6000km is (3600/6000)*100% = 60%

Math,1a,"Question: Keegan is in school for 7.5 hours each day and he is taking 7 classes. He has history and chemistry classes for a combined total of 1.5 hours. How many minutes does Keegan spend in one of his other classes on average?
Answer: He has 7-2=<<7-2=5>>5 other classes
7.5 hours - 1.5 hours = <<7.5-1.5=6>>6 hours
6 hours = <<6*60=360>>360 minutes
360/5 = <<360/5=72>>72 minutes
Keegan spends 72 minutes in one of his other classes.

Question: Bogan laid out 10 maggots for her pet beetle. The beetle only ate 1 and Bogan had to throw out the rest. Later that day, she tried feeding again and the beetle ate 3. If Bogan served 20 maggots in total, how many did she attempt to feed the beetle the second time?
Answer: Bogan served a total of <<20=20>>20 maggots
Bogan gave the beetles 10 maggots in the first feeding
Bogan gave the beetles 20-10=<<20-10=10>>10 maggots in the second feeding

Question: Michael is traveling on the interstate at an average speed of 50km/hr (taking into account all the necessary stops for gas, relaxation, etc.). If he goes on like this for 3 days, and the distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km, what percentage of this distance has he covered?","Answer: 

Michael travels at 50 km/hr for 3 days, so he covers a total distance of 50 km/hr * 24 hr/day * 3 days = 3600 km.

Therefore, Michael has covered 3600 km / 6000 km = 0.6 or 60% of the total distance between Alaska and Texas.","There are 24 hours in each day, so he has been traveling for a total of 3*24 = <<24*3=72>>72 hours
At a rate of 50km/hr he has covered 50*72 = <<50*72=3600>>3600 km
3600km as a percentage of 6000km is (3600/6000)*100% = 60%

Math,1b,"Question: If Joe spent 1/9 of his pocket money of $450 on chocolates and 2/5 on fruits, how much money does he have left?
Answer: Joe spent 1/9 * $450 = $<<1/9*450=50>>50 on chocolate.
Joe spent 2/5 * $450 = $<<2/5*450=180>>180 on fruits.

Therefore, he covers 150 * 3 = <<150*3=450>>450 km in total.
The percentage he has covered is (450 / 6000) * 100% = 7.5%.
