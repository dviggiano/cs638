Would a dog respond to bell before Grey seal?","It is likely that a dog would respond to a bell before a grey seal, as dogs have highly sensitive hearing and can detect sounds from a far distance. However, it is also possible that a grey seal may be trained to respond to certain auditory cues, such as a bell, in a controlled environment.
