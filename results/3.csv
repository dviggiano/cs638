Math,1a,"Q: Ginger likes to make cakes for every holiday for people.  She has 2 children, each of whom she bakes a cake for on their birthdays, Christmas, Easter, and Halloween.  She has a husband for whom she makes a cake on these same holidays, as well as on their anniversary and Valentine's Day. Lastly, she makes both her parents cakes as well, but only for their birthdays since they live far away.  How many cakes does she make in 10 years?
A: Ginger has 2 children whom she bakes for 4 times a year, for 2*4= <<2*4=8>>8 cakes.
She makes her husband 6 cakes a year.
She makes each of her 2 parents a cake for 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 cakes.
On a yearly basis, she therefore makes 8+6+2= <<8+6+2=16>>16 cakes.
In 10 years, she would make 16*10=<<16*10=160>>160 cakes.

Q: A club is going to get additional members so that they will have 5 more than twice their current number of their members. If the club has 10 members now, how many additional members do they need?
A: Twice the current number of members now is 10 * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 members
So, the club wants to have 20 + 5 = <<20+5=25>>25 members.
Therefore, they need to get 25 - 10 = <<25-10=15>>15 members.

Q: Zilla spent 7% of her monthly earnings on rent, half of it on her other monthly expenses, and put the rest in her savings. If she spent $133 on her rent, how much does she deposit into her savings account in a month?
A: Since $133 is equal to 7% of her earnings, then 1% is equal to $133/7 = $<<133/7=19>>19.
The total monthly earning of Zilla is represented by 100%, so $19 x 100 = $<<19*100=1900>>1900 is her monthly earnings.
So, $1900/2 = $<<1900/2=950>>950 is spent on her other monthly expenses.
The total amount spent on the rent and other monthly expenses is $133 + $950 = $<<133+950=1083>>1083.
Hence, she saves $1900 - $1083 = $<<1900-1083=817>>817 per month.

Q: At his craftwork store, Howard has a collection of 70 wooden bowls where he rewards two to his customers for every 10 they buy. If he had 20 customers that day, half of whom bought 20 bowls each, calculate the number of bowls remaining in the rewards collection.
A: Half of the 20 customers, which is 1/2*20=10 bought 20 bowls each, receiving 2 for every 10.
The total number of reward bowls each customer who bought 20 bowls received is 2+2=<<2+2=4>>4
If 10 customers bought 20 bowls, Howard gave away 4*10=<<4*10=40>>40 bowls as rewards.
The total number of reward bowls that remained is 70-40=<<70-40=30>>30

Q: Janet pays $40/hour for 3 hours per week of clarinet lessons and $28/hour for 5 hours a week of piano lessons. How much more does she spend on piano lessons than clarinet lessons in a year?
A: First find the total Janet spends on clarinet lessons per week: $40/hour * 3 hours/week = $<<40*3=120>>120/week
Then find the total Janet spends on piano lessons per week: $28/hour * 5 hours/week = $<<28*5=140>>140/week
Then subtract her weekly clarinet spending from her weekly piano spending to find the weekly difference: $140/week - $120/week = $<<140-120=20>>20/week
Then multiply the weekly difference by the number of weeks in a year to find the annual difference: $20/week * 52 weeks/year = $<<20*52=1040>>1040/year

Q: John reels in 3 crab baskets a week.  Each basket holds 4 crabs.  He collects crabs twice a week.  Each crab sells for $3.  How much money does he make?
A: He collects 3*4=<<3*4=12>>12 crabs each time.
He thus collects 12*2=<<12*2=24>>24 crabs a week.
So he makes 24*3=$<<24*3=72>>72 a week.

","A: If the classroom has 30 boys, and there are three times as many girls as boys, then there are 30*3 = <<30*3=90>>90 girls in the classroom.
If there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as there are boys, then there are 30/10 = <<30/10=3>>3 nongendered children in the classroom.
Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 30 boys + 90 girls + 3 nongendered children = <<30+90+3=123>>123 children. 
#### 123","The classroom has 3 * 30 boys = <<3*30=90>>90 girls.

Math,1a,"Q: This weekend's football game matched the Seattle Seahawks with the Denver Broncos. The final score was 37-23, with the Seattle Seahawks taking the win. If a touchdown is worth 7 points and a field goal is worth 3 points, how many touchdowns did the Seattle Seahawks score if they scored 3 field goals during the game?
A: The Seattle Seahawks scored 3 field goals during the length of the game and each field goal is worth 3 points, so 3 * 3=<<3*3=9>>9 points were made by the Seattle Seahawks from field goals.
The Seattle Seahawks won so their total points would be 37 with 9 of those points accrued through the scoring of field goals, which makes 37-9=<<37-9=28>>28 points left to be scored by touchdowns.
There are 28 points scored by touchdowns and each touchdown is worth 7 points, so this means that 28/7=<<28/7=4>>4 touchdowns were scored by the Seattle Seahawks throughout the game.

Q: The moon has a surface area that is 1/5 that of Earth. The surface area of the Earth is 200 square acres. The land on the moon is worth 6 times that of the land on the Earth. If the total value of all the land on the earth is 80 billion dollars, what is the total value in billions of all the land on the moon?
A: If the moon land had the same value as earth land it would be worth 16 billion because 80 / 5 = <<80/5=16>>16
The moon's total land value is 96 billion because 16 x 6 = <<16*6=96>>96

Math,3b,"Q: This weekend's football game matched the Seattle Seahawks with the Denver Broncos. The final score was 37-23, with the Seattle Seahawks taking the win. If a touchdown is worth 7 points and a field goal is worth 3 points, how many touchdowns did the Seattle Seahawks score if they scored 3 field goals during the game?
A: The Seattle Seahawks scored 3 field goals during the length of the game and each field goal is worth 3 points, so 3 * 3=<<3*3=9>>9 points were made by the Seattle Seahawks from field goals.
The Seattle Seahawks won so their total points would be 37 with 9 of those points accrued through the scoring of field goals, which makes 37-9=<<37-9=28>>28 points left to be scored by touchdowns.
There are 28 points scored by touchdowns and each touchdown is worth 7 points, so this means that 28/7=<<28/7=4>>4 touchdowns were scored by the Seattle Seahawks throughout the game.

Q: The moon has a surface area that is 1/5 that of Earth. The surface area of the Earth is 200 square acres. The land on the moon is worth 6 times that of the land on the Earth. If the total value of all the land on the earth is 80 billion dollars, what is the total value in billions of all the land on the moon?
A: If the moon land had the same value as earth land it would be worth 16 billion because 80 / 5 = <<80/5=16>>16
The moon's total land value is 96 billion because 16 x 6 = <<16*6=96>>96

","A: If the classroom has 30 boys, and there are 3 times as many girls as boys, then there are 30 * 3 = 90 girls in the classroom.
If there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, then there are 30 / 10 = 3 nongendered children in the classroom.
Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 30 (boys) + 90 (girls) + 3 (nongendered) = 123 children.","The classroom has 3 * 30 boys = <<3*30=90>>90 girls.
The classroom has 1/10 nongendered children so 10/100 * 30 boys = <<10/100*30=3>>3 nongendered children.
In total the classroom has 90 + 30 + 3 = <<90+30+3=123>>123 students.
