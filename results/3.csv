Math,1a,"Question: Linda makes $10.00 an hour babysitting.  There is a $25.00 application fee for each college application she submits.  If she is applying to 6 colleges, how many hours will she need to babysit to cover the application fees?
Answer: The application fee is $25.00 per college and she is applying to 6 colleges so that's 25*6 = $<<25*6=150.00>>150.00

Question: A convenience store sold 100 bags of chips in a month. In the first week, 15 bags of chips were sold. In the second week, thrice as many bags of chips were sold. There was an equal number of chips sold in the third and fourth week. How many chips was each sold in the third and fourth week?
Answer: In the second week, 15 x 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 bags of chips were sold.
So there was a total of 45 + 15 = <<45+15=60>>60 bags of chips sold on the first and second week.
Thus, a total of 100 - 60 = <<100-60=40>>40 bags of chips were sold on the third and fourth week.
Therefore, 40/2 = <<40/2=20>>20 bags of chips were each sold on the third and fourth week.

Question: A company produces chocolate in bars. In one day, it can produce 5000 bars. The company sells all the produced bars for $2 per bar. How much money will the company receive for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks?","Answer: The company produces 5000 bars per day and sells them for $2 per bar, so they earn 5000 * $2 = $<<5000*2=10000.00>>10000.00 per day.
In two weeks, there are 14 days, so the company will earn $10000 * 14 = $<<10000*14=140000.00>>140,000.00 for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks.
Therefore, the company will receive $140,000.00 for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks.","During two weeks the company can produce 14 * 5000 = <<14*5000=70000>>70000.
If the price of 1 bar is $2, the company will be able to make 70000 * 2 = $<<70000*2=140000>>140000 from the sales.
