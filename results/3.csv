Math,1a,"Question: Tim's website got 100 visitors a day for the first 6 days and then on the last day of the week it got twice as many visitors as every other day combined.  If he gets $.01 per visit how much did he make that week?
Answer: In the first 6 days, he got 6*100=<<6*100=600>>600 visits
So on the 7th day, he got 600*2=<<600*2=1200>>1200 visitors
So he got a total of 1200+600=<<1200+600=1800>>1800 visitors
That means he made 1800*.01=$<<1800*.01=18>>18

Q: A tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons. Wanda and Ms. B decided to pump water from a pond to fill the tank in two days. On the first day, working in shifts, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity with water, and Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped into the tank that day. On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, while Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day. How many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full?","A tank's capacity is 18000 gallons.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.
Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons on the first day.
Together, they pumped 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons on the first day.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.
Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons on the second day.
Together, they pumped 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons on the second day.

Adding up the total amount of water pumped in two days, they pumped 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.
Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank to be full is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.","On the first day, Wanda pumped 1/4*18000 gallons = <<1/4*18000=4500>>4500 gallons of water.
On the same day, Ms. B pumped 3/4*4500 gallons = <<3/4*4500=3375>>3375 gallons of water into the tank.
They pumped a total of 3375 gallons+ 4500 gallons = <<3375+4500=7875>>7875 gallons together on the first day
On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 * 4500 gallons = <<2/3*4500=3000>>3000 gallons
Ms. B also pumped 3375 gallons * 1/3 = <<3375*1/3=1125>>1125 gallons
Together, on the second day, they pumped 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = <<3000+1125=4125>>4125 gallons
In the two days, they pumped a total of 4125 gallons + 7875 gallons = <<4125+7875=12000>>12000 gallons
The amount of gallons remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = <<18000-12000=6000>>6000 gallons

Math,1a,"Question: Joshua bought 25 oranges for $12.50. If he sells each one for 60c, how much profit in cents will he make on each orange?
Answer: $1 is equivalent to 100 cents so $12.50 is equivalent to 100*12.50 = <<12.50*100=1250>>1250 cents
He bought 25 oranges for 1250 cents so each orange cost 1250/25 = <<1250/25=50>>50 cents each
If he sells each orange for 60 cents, he is making a profit of 60-50 = <<60-50=10>>10 cents on each one.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, while Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day. How many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full?","Let's calculate the amount of water each person pumped on the first day:

Wanda pumped 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons on the first day.
Ms. B pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons on the first day.

Together, they pumped 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons on the first day.

Now let's calculate the amount of water pumped on the second day:

Wanda pumped 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons on the second day.
Ms. B pumped 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons on the second day.

Together, they pumped 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons on the second day.

The total amount of water pumped over the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Therefore, there are 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full.","On the first day, Wanda pumped 1/4*18000 gallons = <<1/4*18000=4500>>4500 gallons of water.
