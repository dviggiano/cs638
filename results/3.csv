Math,1a,"A: With $6.00, Erin can buy 4 scoops of ice cream. 
She can buy 2 scoops and get 1 free, so a total of 3 scoops for $4.50. 
She will have $1.50 left over for 1 more scoop, bringing the total to 4 scoops.","Each scoop cost $1.50. If she buys 2, she gets one free. So it will cost her 2 * 1.50 = $<<2*1.50=3.00>>3.00 for thee scoops total.
If you break it down, 3 scoops of ice cream cost $3.00 so 3/3 = $<<3/3=1.00>>1.00 per scoop
Erin has $6.00 and each scoop ends up costing $1.00 each then 6/1 = <<6/1=6>>6 scoops total

Math,1a,"A: Erin can get 2 scoops for $1.50 each, totaling $3.00.
With the deal, she would get 1 extra scoop for free.
So, Erin would only need to spend $3.00 to get a total of 3 scoops of ice cream.
Therefore, Erin should buy 3 scoops of ice cream.","Each scoop cost $1.50. If she buys 2, she gets one free. So it will cost her 2 * 1.50 = $<<2*1.50=3.00>>3.00 for thee scoops total.
If you break it down, 3 scoops of ice cream cost $3.00 so 3/3 = $<<3/3=1.00>>1.00 per scoop

Math,2,"A: With $6.00, Erin can buy 4 scoops of ice cream (2 scoops for $3.00 and get 1 free scoop, totaling 3 scoops for $4.50). So, Erin should buy 4 scoops of ice cream.","Each scoop cost $1.50. If she buys 2, she gets one free. So it will cost her 2 * 1.50 = $<<2*1.50=3.00>>3.00 for thee scoops total.

Math,3a,"A: With $6.00, Erin can buy 4 scoops of ice cream since she gets 1 scoop free, meaning she pays for 2 scoops and gets the 3rd free for a total of 3 scoops.

If each scoop costs $1.50, then for 3 scoops, Erin would pay 2*$1.50 = $3.00.

Therefore, Erin should buy 3 scoops of ice cream.","Each scoop cost $1.50. If she buys 2, she gets one free. So it will cost her 2 * 1.50 = $<<2*1.50=3.00>>3.00 for thee scoops total.

Math,3b,"A: Erin should buy 4 scoops of ice cream. 
She can buy 2 scoops for $3.00 and get 1 scoop free, so she gets a total of 3 scoops for $3.00.
Since each scoop costs $1.50, Erin can buy 3 scoops for $4.50, leaving her with $1.50.
With the remaining $1.50, Erin can buy 1 more scoop of ice cream, giving her a total of 4 scoops for $6.00.","Each scoop cost $1.50. If she buys 2, she gets one free. So it will cost her 2 * 1.50 = $<<2*1.50=3.00>>3.00 for thee scoops total.
