Math,0,"Question: Mary and John got married last weekend.  There were 20 private cars and 12 buses parked outside the church.  After the ceremony, each bus carried 35 people and each car carried 3 people. How many people were inside the church?","To find the total number of people inside the church, we first need to calculate the total number of people who arrived in private cars and buses.

Number of people in private cars = 20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people
Number of people in buses = 12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Total number of people who arrived = 60 people (private cars) + 420 people (buses) = 480 people

Therefore, there were 480 people inside the church for Mary and John's wedding.","There were 20 private cars * 3 people = <<20*3=60>>60 people.
There were 12 buses * 35 people = <<12*35=420>>420 people.
Total inside the church was 60 people + 420 people = <<60+420=480>>480 people.

Question: Jason is trying to figure out whether he can afford a new car. The car he wants costs $32,000, and he can make a down payment of $8,000. He'll have to get a loan for the rest of the amount and make 48 equal monthly payments on it. Each month, he also has to pay interest equal to 5% of that month's payment. How much will Jason's monthly payments be?
Answer: First figure out how much the loan will be: $32,000 - $8,000 = $<<32000-8000=24000>>24,000
Then divide the loan amount by the number of payments to find the monthly payment before interest: $24,000 / 48 months = $<<24000/48=500>>500/month
Then multiply the loan amount by 5% to find out how much the interest is: $500/month * .05 = $<<500*.05=25>>25/month
Then add the interest to the payment amount to find the total monthly payment: $500/month + $25/month = $<<500+25=525>>525/month
