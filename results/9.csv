Math,1a,"Question: Annie brought 20 brownies to school.  She gave half of them to the school administrator to put in the faculty lounge.  Of the remaining brownies, she gave half to her best friend, Carl, and another two to her friend, Simon.  How many brownies did she have left?
Answer: She first gave away half of her 20 brownies, or 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 brownies, to the faculty.
The remaining brownies number 20-10=<<20-10=10>>10 brownies.
She gave half of these remaining brownies, or 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5 brownies, to Carl.
This reduced her number from 10 down to 10-5=<<10-5=5>>5 brownies.
Finally, she gave away another 2, leaving her with 5-2=<<5-2=3>>3 brownies.

Question: There are 3 kids waiting for the swings and twice as many kids waiting for the slide. If each kid waits 2 minutes for the swings and 15 seconds for the slide, how many seconds shorter is the shorter wait?
Answer: First find the total wait time for the swings in minutes: 3 kids * 2 minutes/kid = <<3*2=6>>6 minutes
Then convert that number to seconds: 6 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = <<6*60=360>>360 seconds
Then find the total number of kids waiting for the slide: 3 kids * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 kids
Then find the total wait time for the slide: 15 seconds/kid * 6 kids = 90 seconds
Then subtract the total wait for the slide from the total wait for the swings to find the difference: 360 seconds - 90 seconds = <<360-90=270>>270 seconds

Question: Jackie grew 3"" over the summer.  She is now 2"" shorter than Anne, who is twice the size of Albert.  If Albert is 36"" tall, how tall was Jackie before summer?","First, find Anne's height by doubling Albert's height: 36 inches * 2 = <<36*2=72>>72 inches
Then subtract 2 inches from Anne's height to find Jackie's height after the growth spurt: 72 inches - 2 inches = <<72-2=70>>70 inches
Then subtract the 3-inch growth spurt from Jackie's current height to find her height before summer: 70 inches - 3 inches = <<70-3=67>>67 inches. 
Therefore, Jackie was 67 inches tall before the summer growth spurt.","Anne is twice the size of Albert, who is 36"", so Anne is 2*36 = <<72=72>>72"" tall
Anne is 72"" tall and Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so Jackie is 72-2 = <<72-2=70>>70"" tall
Jackie is currently 70"" tall and grew 3"" over summer, so before summer she was 70-3= <<70-3=67>>67"" tall

Math,1a,"Question: There were 50 candies left in a bowl after Shelly ate 20 candies the previous week. Her friend comes over, bringing twice as much candy as she originally had. Shelly adds this to the bowl and they decide to divide them equally. How much candy did her friend have after eating 10 of her candies?
Answer: The total number of candies Shelley had before eating some is 50 + 20 = <<50+20=70>>70 candies.
When her friend came over, she brought 2*70 = <<2*70=140>>140 candies.
The total number of candies in the bowl is now 140+50= <<140+50=190>>190 candies.
When they divide this equally between them, each gets 190/2 = <<190/2=95>>95 candies.
When Shelly’s friend eats 10 of her candies, she still has 95-10 = <<95-10=85>>85 candies.

Question: If Beth is 18 years old and her little sister is 5, in how many years would she be twice her sister's age?
Answer: The age difference between Beth and her sister is 18 - 5 = <<18-5=13>>13 years.
Beth must be 13 x 2 = <<13*2=26>>26 to be twice her sister's age.
Beth will be twice her sister's age in 26 - 18 = <<26-18=8>>8 years.

Question: Jackie grew 3"" over the summer.  She is now 2"" shorter than Anne, who is twice the size of Albert.  If Albert is 36"" tall, how tall was Jackie before summer?","To find out how tall Jackie was before the summer, we first need to determine Anne's height and then Jackie's height.

Since Anne is currently 3"" taller than Jackie and Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, Anne's current height is 3 + 3 = 6"" taller than Jackie's previous height.

If Anne is now 6"" taller than Jackie, and Anne is twice the size of Albert, then Anne's current height is 36"" (Albert's height) + 6"" = 42"".

Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, and Anne is currently 42"" tall, Albert's height is 42"" / 2 = 21"".

Therefore, Jackie's previous height was 42"" - 6"" = 36"".

Therefore, Jackie was originally 36"" tall before the summer.
#### 36","Anne is twice the size of Albert, who is 36"", so Anne is 2*36 = <<72=72>>72"" tall
Anne is 72"" tall and Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so Jackie is 72-2 = <<72-2=70>>70"" tall
Jackie is currently 70"" tall and grew 3"" over summer, so before summer she was 70-3= <<70-3=67>>67"" tall

The remaining brownies number 20-10=<<20-10=10>>10 brownies.

Question: There are 3 kids waiting for the swings and twice as many kids waiting for the slide. If each kid waits 2 minutes for the swings and 15 seconds for the slide, how many seconds shorter is the shorter wait?
Answer: First find the total wait time for the swings in minutes: 3 kids * 2 minutes/kid = <<3*2=6>>6 minutes
Then convert that number to seconds: 6 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = <<6*60=360>>360 seconds
Then find the total number of kids waiting for the slide: 3 kids * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 kids
Then find the total wait time for the slide: 15 seconds/kid * 6 kids = 90 seconds
Then subtract the total wait for the slide from the total wait for the swings to find the difference: 360 seconds - 90 seconds = <<360-90=270>>270 seconds
