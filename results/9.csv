Question: Rich likes to take long walks through town.  First he walks 20 feet from his house to the sidewalk.  Then he walks 200 feet down the sidewalk to the end of the road.  Then he makes a left and walks double his total distance so far until he reaches the next intersection.  Then he walks half the total distance up to this point again to the end of his route, before turning around and walking the same path all the way back home.  How many feet did Rich walk?
Answer: Rich walks 20+200= <<20+200=220>>220 feet to get to the end of the road.
He then walks double that distance, 220*2= <<220*2=440>>440 feet to the next intersection.
This makes a total of 220+440= <<220+440=660>>660 feet.
He then walks half that distance, 660/2= <<660/2=330>>330 feet to get to the end of his route.
This makes a total of 660+330=<<660+330=990>>990 feet so far.
He then walks that same distance back, for a total of 990*2= <<990*2=1980>>1980 feet in total.

Q: The basketball team went to the steakhouse to eat dinner.  The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.  The second player ate beef tips, containing 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size.  The third player ate a one-pound steak.  And the fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals.  In total, how many ounces of meat were consumed by the team?","A: The second player ate 8 ounces of beef tips, the third player ate 16 ounces of steak, and the first player ate 6 ounces of steak. This means they consumed 8 + 16 + 6 = <<8+16+6=30>>30 ounces of meat.","The second player consumed 8 1-ounce beef tips, for a total weight of 8*1=<<8*1=8>>8 ounces.
Thus, the total combined weight includes 6 ounces from the first player, 8 ounces from the second player, and 1 pound, which is 16 ounces, from the third player, for a combined total of 6+8+16=<<6+8+16=30>>30 ounces.

Math,1a,"Question: Charley bought 30 pencils. She lost 6 pencils while moving to school, and of course, also lost 1/3 of the remaining pencils because she wasn't very good at keeping track of pencils. How many pencils does she currently have?
Answer: If Charley bought 30 pencils and lost 6 while moving, she remained with 30-6=<<30-6=24>>24 pencils.
Because she isn't good at keeping track of her pencils, Charley lost 1/3*24 = <<1/3*24=8>>8 more pencils.
She currently has 24-8 = <<24-8=16>>16 pencils.

Question: The country of Belize had a 5 lane bridge that had 2000 vehicles passing through it every month. They decided to build a new bridge that had twice the capacity of the old one, and the number of vehicles passing through the new one increased by 60% more than the old bridge. If the bridges work concurrently for a year, calculate the total number of vehicles that pass through the two bridges.
Answer: In a year with 12 months, the total number of vehicles passing through the old bridge is 2000*12 = <<2000*12=24000>>24000
The new bridge has a capacity of 60/100*2000 = <<60/100*2000=1200>>1200 more vehicles passing through it in a month than the old one.
The total number of vehicles passing through the new bridge in a month is 2000+1200 = <<2000+1200=3200>>3200
There are 3200*12 = <<3200*12=38400>>38400 vehicles passing through the new bridge in a year.
Altogether, the two bridges have 38400+24000 = <<38400+24000=62400>>62400 vehicles passing through them in a year.

The third player ate a one-pound steak.  And the fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals.  In total, how many ounces of meat were consumed by the team?","A: The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so they consumed 8 ounces of beef tips. The third player ate a one-pound steak, which is equivalent to 16 ounces. Therefore, in total, the team consumed 6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces of meat.","The second player consumed 8 1-ounce beef tips, for a total weight of 8*1=<<8*1=8>>8 ounces.
Thus, the total combined weight includes 6 ounces from the first player, 8 ounces from the second player, and 1 pound, which is 16 ounces, from the third player, for a combined total of 6+8+16=<<6+8+16=30>>30 ounces.

So, the total amount of meat consumed by the first three players is 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces. 
Since the fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, they did not consume any meat.
