Math,0,"Question: Carson lives in an old house where the pipes will freeze if the temperature inside the house falls below 32 degrees. Every log of wood Carson burns heats the house up by 5 degrees. If it was 45 degrees during the day, and it's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day, how many logs does Carson need to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing?","Carson needs to prevent the temperature from dropping below 32 degrees in order to prevent the pipes from freezing. 

During the day, the temperature is 45 degrees. 
At night, the temperature drops by 33 degrees, so the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees. 

Carson needs to raise the temperature by at least 20 degrees (from 12 degrees to 32 degrees) in order to prevent the pipes from freezing. 

Each log of wood raises the temperature by 5 degrees. 
Therefore, Carson needs to burn 20 / 5 = 4 logs of wood to prevent the pipes from freezing. 

Carson needs to burn 4 logs of wood to prevent the pipes from freezing.","First find the night-time temperature: 45 degrees - 33 degrees = <<45-33=12>>12 degrees
Then find how much Carson needs to heat his house to avoid the pipes freezing: 32 degrees - 12 degrees = <<32-12=20>>20 degrees
Then divide the amount of heat Carson needs by the amount of heat each log produces: 20 degrees / 5 degrees/log = <<20/5=4>>4 logs

Math,1a,"Question: Savannah is wrapping presents for her friends and family for Christmas. She has bought 3 rolls of wrapping paper to wrap 12 gifts. If it takes 1 roll to wrap 3 gifts and 1 roll to wrap 5 other gifts, if there is no wrapping paper leftover after Savannah wraps the rest of the gifts, how many gifts did she wrap with the third roll of paper?
Answer: Savannah has 12 gifts to give her friends and family and has already wrapped 3 gifts + 5 gifts = 8 gifts already wrapped with the first two rolls of paper.
She started off with 12 gifts to wrap and has already wrapped 8, 12 - 8 = <<12-8=4>>4 gifts she wraps with the third roll of paper.

Math,1b,"Question: Luis is driving 80 miles in 2 hours. How far will he go in 15 minutes?
Answer: Luis drives 80/2 = <<80/2=40>>40 miles in 1 hour.
Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, then he drives 40/60 = 2/3 of a mile in 1 minute.

Question: Out of the 150 students, 60% are girls and the rest are boys. Only 1/3 of the boys joined varsity clubs. How many of the boys did not join varsity clubs?
Answer: Out of the 150 students, 100% - 60% = 40% are boys.
So, there are 150 x 40/100 = <<150*40/100=60>>60 boys.
Out of the 60 boys, 60 x 1/3 = <<60*1/3=20>>20 joined varsity clubs.

Carson needs to heat the house up to prevent the pipes from freezing, so he needs to increase the temperature by 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.
