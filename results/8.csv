Math,0,Question: Adam really wants to ride the biggest roller coaster at the park. You have to be 4 feet tall to ride it. Adam’s height is 40 inches and he grows 2 inches a year. How many years until he is tall enough to ride it?,"Adam is currently 40 inches tall, which is equivalent to 3 feet 4 inches. In order to ride the roller coaster, he needs to be 4 feet tall.

To determine how many years it will take for Adam to reach 4 feet in height, we first need to find out how many inches he needs to grow. 

4 feet is equivalent to 48 inches. 
Adam currently needs to grow 48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can divide the remaining inches he needs to grow by the rate of growth:

8 inches / 2 inches = 4 years

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to reach the height of 4 feet and be able to ride the biggest roller coaster at the park.","Adam needs to grow 8 inches because 48 -40= <<48-40=8>>8
It will take 4 years because 8/2=<<8/2=4>>4

Math,1a,"Question: Steve's new book sells 1,000,000 copies.  He got an advance to pay for 100,000 copies. He gets $2 for each copy of the book sold.  His agent takes 10% of that.  How much money did he keep not counting the money from the advance?
Answer: He sold 1,000,000-100,000=<<1000000-100000=900000>>900,000 not counting the advance
So he made 900,000*2=$<<900000*2=1800000>>1,800,000 from selling the books
His agent took 1,800,000*.1=$<<1800000*.1=180000>>180,000
That means he kept 1,800,000-180,000=$<<1800000-180000=1620000>>1,620,000

Answer: The pool is 10*6*20=<<10*6*20=1200>>1200 cubic feet
That means it is 25*1200=<<25*1200=30000>>30000 liters

Question: Adam really wants to ride the biggest roller coaster at the park. You have to be 4 feet tall to ride it. Adam’s height is 40 inches and he grows 2 inches a year. How many years until he is tall enough to ride it?","Answer: Adam needs to grow 12 inches to reach 4 feet, which is equivalent to 48 inches. Since he grows 2 inches a year, it will take him (48-40)/2 = 4 years to reach the height of 4 feet to ride the biggest roller coaster at the park.

Math,1b,"Question: Mike can type 65 words per minute. Due to a minor accident, Mike cannot use his right hand for a while so that his typing speed is now 20 words less per minute. If he is supposed to type a document with 810 words, how many minutes will it take him to finish typing the document?
Answer: After the accident, Mike can only type 65 words/minute - 20 words/minute = <<65-20=45>>45 words/minute.
So, he will be able to finish typing the document in 810 words / 45 words/minute = <<810/45=18>>18 minutes.

Question: Jordan noticed that there are 2 cars in his driveway that each have 4 wheels.  There are 2 bikes and a trash can that each have 2 wheels.  There is also a tricycle and a pair of old roller skates.  How many wheels are there?
Answer: There are 2 cars with 4 wheels each so that's 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 wheels
Two bikes and a trash can each have 2 wheels so that's 3*2 = 6 wheels
Each roller skate has 4 wheels and there is a pair, which means 2 skates for a total of 4*2 = <<4*2=8>>8 wheels
Including the 3 wheels on the tricycle, there are 8 from the car, 6 from bikes and a trashcan and 8 from roller skates for a total of 3+8+6+8 = <<3+8+6+8=25>>25 wheels

Question: Adam really wants to ride the biggest roller coaster at the park. You have to be 4 feet tall to ride it. Adam’s height is 40 inches and he grows 2 inches a year. How many years until he is tall enough to ride it?","Answer: 4 feet is equal to 48 inches, which is the height required to ride the roller coaster. Adam currently is 40 inches tall, so he needs to grow an additional 48 - 40 = 8 inches to reach the minimum height requirement.
If Adam grows 2 inches per year, it will take him 8 inches / 2 inches per year = 4 years to reach the height of 48 inches or 4 feet.
Therefore, Adam will need to wait for <<4>>4 years before he is tall enough to ride the biggest roller coaster at the park.","Adam needs to grow 8 inches because 48 -40= <<48-40=8>>8
