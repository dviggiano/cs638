Math,0,"Question: In a grocery store, four apples cost $5.20, and three oranges cost $3.30. How much will Clyde pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges?","Let's first find the cost of one apple and one orange.

Each apple costs 5.20 / 4 = $1.30
Each orange costs 3.30 / 3 = $1.10

Now, Clyde wants to buy 5 apples and 5 oranges.
The total cost for 5 apples = 5 * $1.30 = $6.50
The total cost for 5 oranges = 5 * $1.10 = $5.50

Therefore, Clyde will pay $6.50 + $5.50 = $12 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.","Each apple costs $5.20/4 = $<<5.20/4=1.30>>1.30.
Each orange cost $3.30/3 = $<<3.30/3=1.10>>1.10.
So 5 apples cost $1.30 x 5 = $<<5*1.30=6.50>>6.50.
And 5 oranges cost $1.10 x 5 = $<<5*1.1=5.50>>5.50.
Thus, Clyde will pay $6.50 + $5.50 = $<<6.5+5.5=12>>12 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

Question: Sara got her first paycheck of two weeks of work. She had worked 40 hours a week at $11.50 per hour. The first thing she did was buy a new set of tires for her car for $410. How much money was she left with?
Answer: Sara worked 40 * 2 = <<40*2=80>>80 hours over two weeks.
She earned 11.50 * 80 = $<<11.50*80=920>>920

The cost of 1 orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.
Clyde will pay for 5 apples, $1.30 * 5 = $6.50.
Clyde will pay for 5 oranges, $1.10 * 5 = $5.50.
In total Clyde will pay $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.","Each apple costs $5.20/4 = $<<5.20/4=1.30>>1.30.
Each orange cost $3.30/3 = $<<3.30/3=1.10>>1.10.
So 5 apples cost $1.30 x 5 = $<<5*1.30=6.50>>6.50.
And 5 oranges cost $1.10 x 5 = $<<5*1.1=5.50>>5.50.

Answer: There were 80/2 = <<80/2=40>>40 wireless mice sold.
There were 80/4 = <<80/4=20>>20 optical mice sold.
So, there were a total of 40 + 20 = <<40+20=60>>60 wireless and optical mice sold.

Question: A radio show plays for 3 hours a day. They split their show into talking segments, ad breaks and songs. Talking segments last 10 minutes each, ad breaks last 5 minutes each and songs are played throughout the rest of the show. If the radio show includes 3 talking segments and 5 ad breaks in today’s show, how long, in minutes, does the show play songs?
Answer: The entire radio show plays for 3 hours * 60 minutes = <<3*60=180>>180 minutes.
The talking segments use 3 talking segments * 10 minutes per talking segment = <<3*10=30>>30 minutes each.
The ad breaks use 5 ad breaks * 5 minutes per ad break = <<5*5=25>>25 minutes.
In total, the talking segments and ad breaks use 30+ 25 = <<30+25=55>>55 minutes.
This leaves 180 – 55 = <<180-55=125>>125 minutes for the radio show to play songs.

Question: In a grocery store, four apples cost $5.20, and three oranges cost $3.30. How much will Clyde pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges?","Answer: 
Let's first calculate the cost of one apple by dividing the total cost of four apples by four: $5.20 / 4 = $1.30 per apple.

Next, let's calculate the cost of one orange by dividing the total cost of three oranges by three: $3.30 / 3 = $1.10 per orange.

Clyde will pay for 5 apples: 5 * $1.30 = $6.50.

Clyde will pay for 5 oranges: 5 * $1.10 = $5.50.

Therefore, Clyde will pay a total of $6.50 + $5.50 = $12 for 5 apples and 5 oranges. 
#### $12","Each apple costs $5.20/4 = $<<5.20/4=1.30>>1.30.
Each orange cost $3.30/3 = $<<3.30/3=1.10>>1.10.
