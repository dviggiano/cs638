Math,1a,"Question: Flies are Betty's frog's favorite food. Every day the frog eats 2 flies. Betty puts the flies she finds in a bottle. In the morning Betty catches 5 flies inside a bottle, and in the afternoon she catches 6 more, but when she removes the lid, one escapes.  Betty wants to gather the whole week's food for her frog. How many more flies does she need?
Answer: The frog eats 2 flies/day * 7 days/week = <<2*7=14>>14 flies a week.
Betty catches flies in the morning and in the afternoon, for a total of 5 flies + 6 flies = <<5+6=11>>11 flies.
But 1 fly escapes, leaving 11 flies - 1 fly = <<11-1=10>>10 flies.
To get her frog's food for the whole week, Betty needs 14 flies - 10 flies = <<14-10=4>>4 more flies.

Question: Mr. Maximilian is a dairy animal farmer and has 140 cows on his farm. Forty percent of the cows on his farm have a red spot, 25 percent of the cows without a red spot have a blue spot and the remaining cows do not have any spot. How many cows on the farm have no spot?
Answer: If Mr. Maximilian has 140 cows and 40% of them have red spots, then 40/100*140 = <<140*40/100=56>>56 cows have red spots.
The number of cows with no red spot is 140-56 = <<140-56=84>>84 cows.
Out of the 84 cows without a red spot, 25% of them have a blue spot, a total of 25/100*84 = <<25/100*84=21>>21 cows.
The number of cows without any spot is 84-21 =<<84-21=63>>63 animals.

Q: Sue lives in a fun neighborhood.  One weekend, the neighbors decided to play a prank on Sue.  On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos out on Sue's front yard.  On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, painted them white, and put these newly painted white flamingos back out on Sue's front yard.  Then, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. At noon on Sunday, how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos?","A: 
On Saturday morning, one third of the 18 pink flamingos were taken back, which is 18/3 = <<18/3=6>>6 flamingos.
After painting these 6 flamingos white, they were put out in the yard, adding up to a total of 18 existing white flamingos + 6 newly painted white flamingos = <<18+6=24>>24 white flamingos.
On Sunday morning, another 18 pink flamingos were added, making the total number of pink flamingos 18 existing pink flamingos + 18 new pink flamingos = <<18+18=36>>36 pink flamingos.
Therefore, there are 36 pink flamingos - 24 white flamingos = <<36-24=12>>12 more pink flamingos than white flamingos.","On Saturday, one third of the original 18 pink flamingos were removed and painted white: 18*1/3=<<18*1/3=6>>6 white flamingos.
This left 18 pink - 6 = <<18-6=12>>12 pink flamingos.
On Sunday, 18 more pink flamingos were added, for a total of 12 + 18 = <<12+18=30>>30 pink flamingos on the front lawn.
Altogether, there were 30 pink and 6 white flamingos on the lawn, so there were 30 pink - 6 white =<<30-6=24>>24 more pink flamingos.

Math,1a,"Question: Eighteen hours ago, Beth and I took 100 photographs of our project. Today, Beth and I will take 20% fewer photographs of the same project. If we were to take 300 photographs of the project, how many photographs would we take to reach the target?
Answer: If you took 100 photographs of the project 18 hours ago, and today 20% few photographs have been taken, then 20/100*100 = 20 fewer photographs of the project have been taken today.
The total number of photographs of the project that have been taken today is 100-20 = <<100-20=80>>80
So far, you've taken 80+100 = <<80+100=180>>180 photographs of the project.
Since the target number of photographs is 300, the number of photographs that you need to take to reach the target is 300-180 = <<300-180=120>>120

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos out. On Sunday, another 18 pink flamingos were added, making a total of 18 + 18 = 36 pink flamingos out.

Now, let's calculate how many white flamingos are out. 
Initially, one third of the flamingos were taken back on Saturday to paint them white, which means 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos were painted white and placed back out.

Therefore, there are 36 - 6 = 30 more pink plastic flamingos out than white plastic flamingos at noon on Sunday.","On Saturday, one third of the original 18 pink flamingos were removed and painted white: 18*1/3=<<18*1/3=6>>6 white flamingos.

Then, on Sunday morning, another 18 pink flamingos were added, making the total number of pink flamingos 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.
