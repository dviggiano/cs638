Question: Jaime is a computer programmer for a company that currently has employed 100 people. Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers. If the number of Junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, and they are each paid $2000 per month, calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month.","First, find the total number of junior programmers: 100 employees * 2/5 = 40 employees
Then find the total number of senior programmers: 100 employees - 40 employees = 60 employees
Then find the total amount of money paid to junior programmers: 40 employees * $2000 = $<<40*2000=80000>>80,000
Then find how much senior programmers are paid: $2000 + $400 = $2400
Then find the total amount of money paid to senior programmers: 60 employees * $2400 = $<<60*2400=144000>>144,000
Then add the two amounts to find the total amount paid to all programmers: $80,000 + $144,000 = $<<80000+144000=224000>>224,000 per month. 
The company pays a total of $224,000 to all the programmers per month.","The number of junior programmers in the company is 2/5*100 = <<2/5*100=40>>40

If the number of Junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, and they are each paid $2000 per month, calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month.","Answer: If the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, then the number of junior programmers is 2/5 * 100 = <<2/5*100=40>>40.
Since senior programmers are 400 dollars more than junior programmers who earn $2000, they are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.
The total amount of money paid to the senior programmers is $2400 * 60 = $144,000.
The total amount of money paid to the junior programmers is $2000 * 40 = $80,000.

The total amount paid to junior programmers per month is 40 * $2000 = $<<2*40*2000=160000>>160,000.
If senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, they each earn $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

Question: Jaime is a computer programmer for a company that currently has employed 100 people. Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers. If the number of Junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, and they are each paid $2000 per month, calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month.","First, we need to find the number of junior programmers. Since the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, we have:

Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * 100 = 40

Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month, so the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:

Total amount for junior programmers = 40 * $2000 = $80,000

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, they are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

The number of senior programmers is the total number of programmers (100) minus the number of junior programmers (40), which is:

Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60

The total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:

Total amount for senior programmers = 60 * $2400 = $144,000

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the amounts paid to junior and senior programmers:

Total amount paid to all programmers = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000","The number of junior programmers in the company is 2/5*100 = <<2/5*100=40>>40
The total amount of money that the company pays to the Junior employees is $2000*40 = $<<2000*40=80000>>80000
There are also 100-40 = <<100-40=60>>60 senior programmers in the company.
The senior programmers are paid $2000+$400 = $<<2000+400=2400>>2400 each.
Senior programmers at the company receive 2400*60 = $<<2400*60=144000>>144000 combined.
All the programmers in the company are paid a combined salary of 144000+80000 = <<144000+80000=224000>>224000
