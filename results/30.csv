Math,1a,"Question: Evelyn’s family watched 10 hours of television last week. The week before, they watched 8 hours of television. If they watch 12 hours of television next week, what is the average number of hours of television that they watch per week?
Answer: Over the three weeks, they will have watched a total of 10 + 8 + 12 = <<10+8+12=30>>30 hours of television.
The average number of hours per week is 30 hours / 3 = <<30/3=10>>10 hours of television.

Question: Tonya spent $90.00 on art supplies.  4 canvases cost $40.00 and a mixed set of paints cost 1/2 that much. She also spent $15.00 on an easel, and the rest of the money on paintbrushes. How much money did she spend on paintbrushes?
Answer: The canvases cost $40.00 and she spent half that amount on paint so she spent 40/2 = $<<40/2=20.00>>20.00 on paint
She spent $40.00 on canvases, $20.00 on paint and $15.00 on an easel so she spent 40+20+15 = $<<40+20+15=75.00>>75.00
She spent $90.00 total and her other purchases totaled $75.00 so she spent 90-75 = $<<90-75=15.00>>15.00 on paint brushes

Q: Two track teams are competing against each other in a 4 by 400 meter relay; a race where each competing team has four members that each run 400 meters, or one lap, around a standard track.  One of the two teams is very well-rounded and each of their members will run their 400 meter leg in precisely 55 seconds.  The other team is less well-rounded; their first runner will run their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds then each subsequent runner will be 3 seconds faster than the previous runner.  Using this information, how many seconds will the faster team win by?","A 4 by 400 meter relay consists of 4 legs, each 400 meters long, so the total distance each team runs is 4 * 400 = 1600 meters.

For the well-rounded team, each runner runs 400 meters in 55 seconds, so the total time for the team is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

For the less well-rounded team, the first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds, the second runner runs 400 meters in 57 seconds, the third runner runs 400 meters in 54 seconds, and the fourth runner runs 400 meters in 51 seconds. 

Adding all these times together, the total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The well-rounded team completes the 1600 meters in 220 seconds and the less well-rounded team completes it in 222 seconds, so the faster team wins by 222 - 220 = 2 seconds. 

Therefore, the faster team will win by 2 seconds.","The first team will finish the relay in 4*55 = <<4*55=220>>220 seconds.
On the second team we must determine each runner's individual pace. We know the first runner will complete their leg in 60 seconds, so the second runner will take 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, then the third will take 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth will take 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
Thus, the second team will finish the relay in 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = <<60+57+54+51=222>>222 seconds.
Therefore, the first team will finish 222 - 220 = <<222-220=2>>2 seconds faster than the second team.

Question: If Stu has 9 books and Albert has 4 times as many books as Stu, how many books do Stu and Albert have in total?
Answer: Albert has 4 * 9 books belonging to Stu = <<4*9=36>>36 books.

The other team is less well-rounded; their first runner will run their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds then each subsequent runner will be 3 seconds faster than the previous runner.  Using this information, how many seconds will the faster team win by?","To find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time it takes for each team to complete the race.

For the well-rounded team:
All 4 members will run 400 meters each in 55 seconds, so the total time taken would be 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

For the less well-rounded team:
The first runner will run the 400 meters in 60 seconds.
The second runner will run it in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner will run it in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner will run it in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
So, the total time taken by the less well-rounded team would be 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

Therefore, the faster team will win by 222 (total time taken by less well-rounded team) - 220 (total time taken by well-rounded team) = 2 seconds. 

The faster team will win by 2 seconds.","The first team will finish the relay in 4*55 = <<4*55=220>>220 seconds.
On the second team we must determine each runner's individual pace. We know the first runner will complete their leg in 60 seconds, so the second runner will take 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, then the third will take 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth will take 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
Thus, the second team will finish the relay in 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = <<60+57+54+51=222>>222 seconds.
Therefore, the first team will finish 222 - 220 = <<222-220=2>>2 seconds faster than the second team.

For the other team, the time it will take for the first runner to finish the race is 60 seconds. The second runner will take 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner will take 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner will take 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. So, the total time for the less well-rounded team to finish the race is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

Therefore, the faster team will win by 222 seconds (total time taken by the less well-rounded team) - 220 seconds (total time taken by the well-rounded team) = 2 seconds.","The first team will finish the relay in 4*55 = <<4*55=220>>220 seconds.

The second runner of the slower team runs at 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.

The fourth runner runs at 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

The slower team's total time is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.
The faster team's total time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

Using this information, how many seconds will the faster team win by?","First, let's calculate the total time it will take for each team to complete the relay race.

For the well-rounded team:
Each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds, so the total time for the team is 4 members * 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

For the less well-rounded team:
The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds.
The second runner runs 400 meters in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner runs 400 meters in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner runs 400 meters in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
So, the total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

Therefore, the faster team will win by 222 seconds (total time for less well-rounded team) - 220 seconds (total time for well-rounded team) = 2 seconds. 

The faster team will win by 2 seconds.","The first team will finish the relay in 4*55 = <<4*55=220>>220 seconds.
