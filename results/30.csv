Question: Solomon bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. If his father also gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna, and each marble weighs 2kgs, calculate the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store.","Answer: Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, so he has a total of 20 marbles + 50 marbles = <<20+50=70>>70 marbles in the store.
His father gave him 2/5 * 20 marbles = <<2/5*20=8>>8 marbles.
