Math,0,"Question: If a bag of marbles costs $20 and the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, how much would a bag of marbles cost after 36 months?","To calculate the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to determine the price increase every two months for the duration of 36 months.

The price increases by 20% every two months. Therefore, after 1 month, the price would be $20 + $20 x 0.20 = $24.

After 2 months, the price would be $24 + $24 x 0.20 = $28.80.

Continuing this pattern, after 36 months, the price would be $20 x (1.20)^18 = $139.67.

Therefore, after 36 months, a bag of marbles would cost $139.67.","When the price of the bag of marble increase by 20%, the price increases by 20/100*20 = $<<20/100*20=4>>4
If the price increases after every two months, in 36 months, it will increase 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 times.
If each increase is $4, the total amount the price of the bag of marbles will have increased by after 36 months is 18*$4 = $<<18*4=72>>72
After the total increase of the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, the total cost will be $20+$72 = $<<20+72=92>>92

Math,1a,"Question: John can front squat 80% as much as he back squats.  He used to back squat 200 kg but increased that by 50 kg.  He can do a triple equal to 90% of the amount he front squats.  How much weight will he move if he does three triples?
Answer: He increased his back squat to 200+50=<<200+50=250>>250 kg
That means his front squat is 250*.8=<<250*.8=200>>200 kg
So he can do a triple with 200*.9=<<200*.9=180>>180 kg
So he moves 180*3 = <<180*3=540>>540 kg if he does three triples

Question: Emberly takes her mornings walks every day. If each walk takes her 1 hour covering 4 miles, and she didn't walk for 4 days in March, calculate the total number of miles she's walked.
Answer: In March, she walked for 31-4 = <<31-4=27>>27 days.
If she walks for an hour a day, the total number of hours she'll walk in March is 27 days*1 hour a day= <<27*1=27>>27 hours.
If each walk is 4 miles, the number of miles she walked in March is 27*4 = <<27*4=108>>108 miles.

Question: If a bag of marbles costs $20 and the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, how much would a bag of marbles cost after 36 months?","Answer: The price of the bag of marbles increases by 20/100*$20 = $4 every two months.
After 36 months, there are 36/2 = 18 two-month periods.
So the total increase in price over 36 months is $4*18 = $<<4*18=72>>72.
Therefore, after 36 months, the cost of a bag of marbles would be $20+$72 = $<<20+72=92>>92.","When the price of the bag of marble increase by 20%, the price increases by 20/100*20 = $<<20/100*20=4>>4
If the price increases after every two months, in 36 months, it will increase 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 times.
If each increase is $4, the total amount the price of the bag of marbles will have increased by after 36 months is 18*$4 = $<<18*4=72>>72

Question: Arnel had ten boxes of pencils with the same number of pencils in each box.  He kept ten pencils and shared the remaining pencils equally with his five friends. If his friends got eight pencils each, how many pencils are in each box?
Answer: Arnel shared 5 x 8 = <<5*8=40>>40 pencils with his friends.
So, he had 10 + 40 = <<10+40=50>>50 pencils in all.
Therefore, each box had 50/10 = <<50/10=5>>5 pencils inside.

Question: If a bag of marbles costs $20 and the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, how much would a bag of marbles cost after 36 months?","To find the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the total number of 2-month periods in 36 months. Since 36 months is 18 two-month periods, the price will increase 18 times.

First, let's calculate the increase in price after each 2-month period:
20% of $20 = 0.20 * 20 = $4

Now we will calculate the new cost of the bag of marbles after each 2-month period:
After 2 months: $20 + $4 = $24
After 4 months: $24 + $4 = $28
After 6 months: $28 + $4 = $32
...
After 36 months: $20 + (18 * $4) = $20 + $72 = $92

Therefore, a bag of marbles would cost $92 after 36 months.","When the price of the bag of marble increase by 20%, the price increases by 20/100*20 = $<<20/100*20=4>>4
If the price increases after every two months, in 36 months, it will increase 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 times.
If each increase is $4, the total amount the price of the bag of marbles will have increased by after 36 months is 18*$4 = $<<18*4=72>>72
