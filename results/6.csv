Math,1a,"Question: Yesterday, Sarah collected 50 aluminum cans while Lara collected 30 more aluminum cans. Today, Sarah collected 40 while Lara collected 70 aluminum cans. How many fewer cans did they collect today than yesterday?
Answer: Yesterday, Lara collected 50 + 30 = <<50+30=80>>80 aluminum cans.
So Sarah and Lara collected a total of 50 + 80 = <<50+80=130>>130 aluminum cans yesterday.
Today, Sarah and Lara collected a total of 40 + 70 = <<40+70=110>>110 aluminum cans.
Thus, they collected 130 - 110 = <<130-110=20>>20 fewer aluminum cans today than yesterday.

Question: Kimiko watches four YouTube videos. The first video is 2 minutes long, the second video is 4 minutes and 30 seconds, and the last two videos are equal in length. If she spends a total of 510 seconds watching YouTube, how many seconds long was each of the last two videos?
Answer: First convert the length of the first video to seconds: 2 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = <<2*60=120>>120 seconds
Then convert the length of the second video to seconds: 4 minutes * 60 seconds/minute + 30 seconds = 240 seconds + 30 seconds = <<4*60+30=270>>270 seconds
Now subtract the length of the first two videos from the total time Kimiko spent watching to find the combined length of the last two videos: 510 seconds - 120 seconds - 270 seconds = <<510-120-270=120>>120 seconds
Now divide the combined length by the number of videos to find each video's length: 120 seconds / 2 = <<120/2=60>>60 seconds

Question: Each class in a school has 20 students. There are 3 classes. The school as a whole is 50% boys and 50% girls. The first class has 15 girls. The second class has 12 girls. How many boys are in the third class?","Answer: Since each class has 20 students, there are a total of 20 students x 3 classes = 60 students in the school.
Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, there are an equal number of boys and girls, so there are 60 students / 2 = 30 boys in the school.
The first class has 20 students - 15 girls = 5 boys.
The second class has 20 students - 12 girls = 8 boys.
So there are 30 boys - 5 boys - 8 boys = 17 boys in the third class.
#### 17","The school has 60 students because 3 x 20 = <<3*20=60>>60
The school has 30 girls because 60 x .5 = <<60*.5=30>>30
The third class has 3 girls because 30 - 15 - 12 = <<30-15-12=3>>3
The third class has 17 boys because 20 - 3 = <<20-3=17>>17

Math,1a,"Question: Carolyn buys a silverware set with 6 knives, 12 forks, and three times as many spoons as knives. Then her friend trades her 10 knives for 6 spoons. What percentage of Carolyn's silverware is knives?
Answer: First find the final number of knives Carolyn has: 10 knives + 6 knives = <<10+6=16>>16 knives
Then find the initial number of spoons Carolyn has: 6 knives * 3 spoons/knife = <<6*3=18>>18 spoons
Then find the final number of spoons Carolyn has: 18 spoons - 6 spoons = <<18-6=12>>12 spoons
Then find the total final amount of silverware Carolyn has: 12 spoons + 16 knives + 12 forks = <<12+16+12=40>>40 pieces
Then divide the number of knives by the total number of pieces and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 16 knives / 40 pieces * 100% = 40%

Question: Ivan has a bird feeder in his yard that holds two cups of birdseed. Every week, he has to refill the emptied feeder. Each cup of birdseed can feed fourteen birds, but Ivan is constantly chasing away a hungry squirrel that steals half a cup of birdseed from the feeder every week. How many birds does Ivan’s bird feeder feed weekly?
Answer: The squirrel steals 1/2 cup of birdseed every week, so the birds eat 2 - 1/2 = 1 1/2 cups of birdseed.
Each cup feeds 14 birds, so Ivan’s bird feeder feeds 14 * 1 1/2 = 21 birds weekly.

Question: Each class in a school has 20 students. There are 3 classes. The school as a whole is 50% boys and 50% girls. The first class has 15 girls. The second class has 12 girls. How many boys are in the third class?","Answer: Since each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes, there are a total of 20 * 3 = 60 students in the school.

If the school as a whole is 50% boys and 50% girls, then there are an equal number of boys and girls, so there are 60 / 2 = 30 boys in the school.

If the first class has 15 girls and 20 students total, then there are 20 - 15 = 5 boys in the first class.

If the second class has 12 girls and 20 students total, then there are 20 - 12 = 8 boys in the second class.

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is 30 - 5 - 8 = 17 boys.","The school has 60 students because 3 x 20 = <<3*20=60>>60
The school has 30 girls because 60 x .5 = <<60*.5=30>>30
The third class has 3 girls because 30 - 15 - 12 = <<30-15-12=3>>3
The third class has 17 boys because 20 - 3 = <<20-3=17>>17

Math,2,"Question: Yesterday, Sarah collected 50 aluminum cans while Lara collected 30 more aluminum cans. Today, Sarah collected 40 while Lara collected 70 aluminum cans. How many fewer cans did they collect today than yesterday?
Answer: Yesterday, Lara collected 50 + 30 = <<50+30=80>>80 aluminum cans.
So Sarah and Lara collected a total of 50 + 80 = <<50+80=130>>130 aluminum cans yesterday.
Today, Sarah and Lara collected a total of 40 + 70 = <<40+70=110>>110 aluminum cans.
Thus, they collected 130 - 110 = <<130-110=20>>20 fewer aluminum cans today than yesterday.

Question: Kimiko watches four YouTube videos. The first video is 2 minutes long, the second video is 4 minutes and 30 seconds, and the last two videos are equal in length. If she spends a total of 510 seconds watching YouTube, how many seconds long was each of the last two videos?
Answer: First convert the length of the first video to seconds: 2 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = <<2*60=120>>120 seconds
Then convert the length of the second video to seconds: 4 minutes * 60 seconds/minute + 30 seconds = 240 seconds + 30 seconds = <<4*60+30=270>>270 seconds
Now subtract the length of the first two videos from the total time Kimiko spent watching to find the combined length of the last two videos: 510 seconds - 120 seconds - 270 seconds = <<510-120-270=120>>120 seconds
Now divide the combined length by the number of videos to find each video's length: 120 seconds / 2 = <<120/2=60>>60 seconds

Since each class has 20 students, the first two classes have a total of 20 * 2 = 40 students.

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, there are an equal number of boys and girls, so there are 60 students / 2 = 30 boys and 30 girls in the school.
If the first class has 15 girls, then it has 20 students - 15 girls = 5 boys.
