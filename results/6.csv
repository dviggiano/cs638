Math,0,"Question: On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. At the till she got $2 off because she had a voucher. The next day, the price shot to $30 per fruit, but the store also offered a 10% discount on the total cost. Sheila took advantage of the discount and bought 20 pomegranates. What is the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days?","First, let's calculate the total cost for Clara's purchase on Tuesday:

20 pomegranates at $20 each = 20 * $20 = $400
After applying the $2 voucher, the total cost becomes $400 - $2 = $398

Next, let's calculate the total cost for Sheila's purchase on Wednesday:

20 pomegranates at $30 each = 20 * $30 = $600
Sheila received a 10% discount, so the total cost becomes $600 - (10% of $600) = $600 - $60 = $540

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $540 - $398 = $142. 

Therefore, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $142.","On Tuesday, the pomegranates cost Clara 20 pomegranates * $20/pomegranates = $<<20*20=400>>400
Using the voucher, she paid $400 - $2 = $<<400-2=398>>398
On Wednesday, the pomegranates cost Sheila 20 pomegranates * $30 = $<<20*30=600>>600.
She then got a discount of 10/100 * $600 = $<<10/100*600=60>>60
Sheila ended up paying $600 - $60 = $<<600-60=540>>540
The difference is therefore $540 - $398 = $<<540-398=142>>142

Math,1a,"Question: During a soccer game, in the first half, Team A scored 8 points, and Team B scored only half as many points. In the second half, Team B was able to get as many points as Team A in the first half, and Team A scored only 2 goals less than Team B. How many goals did both teams score during the whole match?
Answer: During the first half Team, B scored only 8 * 0.5 = <<8*0.5=4>>4 points.
In the second half Team A scored 2 goals less than Team B, so they scored 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 points.
So in total both teams scored 8 + 4 + 6 + 8 = <<8+4+6+8=26>>26 points.

Question: Walter works 5 days a week in a fast-food chain and earns $5 per hour. Since he is a working student, he can only work 4 hours a day and allocates 3/4 of his weekly earning for his schooling. How much does he allocate for school?
Answer: Walter's daily earning is $5 x 4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.
So he earns $20 x 5 = $<<20*5=100>>100 per week.
Therefore, he allocates $100 x 3/4 = $<<100*3/4=75>>75 for his school.

The total cost of the pomegranates on Tuesday was 20 pomegranates x $20 = $400.
With the $2 discount, Clara paid $400 - $2 = $398.

The total cost of the pomegranates on Wednesday was 20 pomegranates x $30 = $600.

Is overfeeding Lactobacillus unwise for people without dental insurance?","Yes, it would be unwise for people without dental insurance to overfeed Lactobacillus species that produce lactic acid, as this can contribute to tooth decay. Without insurance, dental procedures can be expensive, so it's important to prioritize oral health and avoid behaviors that may lead to dental issues, such as consuming excessive amounts of foods that promote the growth of decay-causing bacteria.
