Math,1a,"Question: Three buckets are holding different fruits. Bucket A has 4 more pieces of fruit than bucket B while bucket B has 3 more pieces of fruit than bucket C. If bucket C has 9 pieces of fruit, how many pieces of fruit are in all 3 buckets?
Answer: Bucket B has 3 more fruits than C (which has 9 fruits) for a total of 9+3 = <<3+9=12>>12 fruits
Bucket A has 4 more fruits than B (which has 12 fruits) for a total of 12+4 = <<4+12=16>>16 fruits
All three buckets have a total of 9+12+16 = <<9+12+16=37>>37 fruits

Question: The math questions in a contest are divided into three rounds: easy, average, and hard. There are corresponding points given for each round. That is 2, 3, and 5 points for every correct answer in the easy, average, and hard rounds, respectively. Suppose Kim got 6 correct answers in the easy; 2 correct answers in the average; and 4 correct answers in the difficult round, what are her total points in the contest?
Answer: Kim got 6 points/round x 2 round = <<6*2=12>>12 points in the easy round.
She got 2 points/round x 3 rounds = <<2*3=6>>6 points in the average round.
She got 4 points/round x 5 rounds = <<4*5=20>>20 points in the difficult round.
So her total points is 12 points + 6 points + 20 points = <<12+6+20=38>>38 points.

Q: Morgan's dad said that she had $90 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and get to ride the go-karts twice. A round of mini-golf is $5. The Go-karts cost $10 a ride. How many friends can she invite?","A round of mini-golf costs $5, arcade tokens cost $5, and riding the go-karts twice cost 2 rides x $10/ride = $<<5+5+10*2=30>>30.
Subtracting all these expenses from her $90 budget, she has $90 - $30 = $<<90-30=60>>60 left for her friends' expenses.
Each friend will cost $5 for mini-golf and arcade tokens, plus $20 for the go-karts (2 rides x $10/ride) for a total of $5 + $5 + $20 = $<<5+5+20=30>>30.
So she can invite $60 budget / $30 per friend = <<60/30=2>>2 friends.
She can invite 2 friends to her birthday party.","The go karts will cost $20 per person because 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20
Each person costs $30 because 5 + 5 + 20 = <<5+5+20=30>>30
Three total people can attend because 90 / 30 = <<90/30=3>>3
She can invite 2 friends because 3 - 1 =<<3-1=2>>2

Question: Phil has a coin collection he likes to add to.  He started with 50 state quarters his parents gave him.  Over the next year he doubled this.  The following year he collected 3 each month.  The year after that he collected 1 every third month.  The year after that he lost a quarter of them when he misplaced his collection.  How many did he have left after losing some?
Answer: Phil started with 50, and doubled this amount the next year for 50*2=<<50*2=100>>100 coins
Phil then collected 3 per month the following year, and since there are 12 months in a year that was 3*12=<<3*12=36>>36 coins added
Phil then collected 1 every third month, and since there are 12 months that means he collected one every 12/3=4 months, for 4 coins added
Before he lost a quarter of his coins, Phil had 100+36+4 coins, or <<100+36+4=140>>140 coins in total.
Losing a quarter of 140 coins means Phill lost 140/4=<<140/4=35>>35 coins
That means Phil had 140-35= <<140-35=105>>105 coins remaining

Q: Morgan's dad said that she had $90 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and get to ride the go-karts twice. A round of mini-golf is $5. The Go-karts cost $10 a ride. How many friends can she invite?","A round of mini-golf costs $5, so Morgan and her friends playing mini-golf will cost 5 * (1 + f) = $5 + $5f, where 1 represents Morgan and f represents the number of friends she invites.
She needs to spend $5 on arcade tokens and $10 per ride on go-karts, so the total cost for those activities is $5 + $10*2 = $25.
Combining all costs, the total cost for the party is $5f + $25.
Since Morgan has a budget of $90, the equation representing the total cost must be less than or equal to $90, so:
$5f + $25 ≤ $90
$5f ≤ $65
f ≤ 13
Therefore, Morgan can invite up to 13 friends to her birthday party.","The go karts will cost $20 per person because 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20
Each person costs $30 because 5 + 5 + 20 = <<5+5+20=30>>30
Three total people can attend because 90 / 30 = <<90/30=3>>3
She can invite 2 friends because 3 - 1 =<<3-1=2>>2

She got 2 points/round x 3 rounds = <<2*3=6>>6 points in the average round.
She got 4 points/round x 5 rounds = <<4*5=20>>20 points in the difficult round.

She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and get to ride the go-karts twice. A round of mini-golf is $5. The Go-karts cost $10 a ride. How many friends can she invite?","A round of mini-golf costs $5, arcade tokens cost $5, and riding the go-karts twice costs $10 per ride, so in total Morgan's expenses are $5 + $5 + ($10 * 2) = $5 + $5 + $20 = $10 + $20 = $30
If Morgan has $90 budgeted and she plans to spend $30 on activities, that leaves $90 - $30 = $60 for her friends to also play mini-golf and ride the go-karts.
Each friend costs $5 for mini-golf and $20 for go-karts (2 rides), so in total, each friend will cost $5 + $20 = $25.
Therefore, Morgan can invite $60 / $25 per friend = 2 friends to her birthday party. 
So in total, Morgan can invite 2 friends to join her birthday celebration.","The go karts will cost $20 per person because 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20
Each person costs $30 because 5 + 5 + 20 = <<5+5+20=30>>30

The Go-karts cost $10 a ride. How many friends can she invite?","A round of mini-golf costs $5 and she wants to play one round, so that's $5.
She also wants $5 in arcade tokens, so that's an additional $5.
Riding the go-karts twice would cost $10 x 2 = $20.
Adding the mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-karts, Morgan would spend $5 + $5 + $20 = $30.
If she had $90 budgeted and spends $30 on activities, she has $90 - $30 = $60 left to spend on her friends.
Each friend would cost $5 to play mini-golf, so she can invite $60 / $5 = 12 friends. 
Therefore, Morgan can invite 12 friends to her birthday party.","The go karts will cost $20 per person because 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20

She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and get to ride the go-karts twice. A round of mini-golf is $5. The Go-karts cost $10 a ride. How many friends can she invite?","First, let's calculate the cost of mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-kart rides combined:
- Mini-golf: $5
- Arcade tokens: $5
- Go-karts: 2 rides * $10/ride = $20
Total cost = $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Subtracting the total cost from Morgan's budget:
$90 - $30 = $60

Since Morgan wants to make sure she and her friends can do everything she planned, she needs to divide the remaining budget of $60 among the number of friends she can invite:
$60 / (cost per friend) = $60 / ($5 + $5 + $10) = $60 / $20 = 3 friends

Therefore, Morgan can invite 3 friends to her birthday party.","The go karts will cost $20 per person because 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20
