Question: Karen is planning writing assignments for her fifth grade class. She knows each short-answer question takes 3 minutes to answer, each paragraph takes 15 minutes to write, and each essay takes an hour to write. If Karen assigns 2 essays and 5 paragraphs, how many short-answer questions should she assign if she wants to assign 4 hours of homework total?
Answer: First figure out how many minutes 4 hours is: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<4*60=240>>240 minutes
Then figure out how long the two essays will take by multiplying the time per essay by the number of essays: 2 essays * 1 hour/essay * 60 minutes/hour = <<2*1*60=120>>120 minutes
Use the same method to find the total time spent writing paragraphs: 15 minutes/paragraph * 5 paragraphs = <<15*5=75>>75 minutes
Now subtract the time spent on essays and paragraphs from the total time to find the time spent on all the short answer questions: 240 minutes - 120 minutes - 75 minutes = <<240-120-75=45>>45 minutes
Finally, divide the total time spent on short-answer questions by the time per question to find the number of questions: 45 minutes / 3 minutes/question = <<45/3=15>>15 questions

Q: Octavia wants to make a quilt for her sister. She is going to build it from small, medium, and large t-shirts that her family is done with. A small t-shirt is 3 square feet of fabric. A medium one is 4 square feet. A large one is 6 square feet. If she uses 11 small shirts, 8 medium, and 6 large shirts, how many square feet is the quilt?","A: First, find the total square footage from the small shirts: 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet
Next, find the total square footage from the medium shirts: 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet
Then, find the total square footage from the large shirts: 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet
Add the square footage from each size of shirt to find the total square footage: 33 square feet + 32 square feet + 36 square feet = 101 square feet
So, the quilt will be 101 square feet.","The quilt has 33 square feet from small shirts because 11 x 3 = <<11*3=33>>33
The quilt has 32 square feet from medium shirts because 8 x 4 = <<8*4=32>>32
The quilt has 36 square feet from large shirts because 6 x 6 = <<6*6=36>>36
The quilt is 101 square feet because 33 + 32 + 36 = <<33+32+36=101>>101

Math,1a,"Question: If it takes 10 people 10 days to shovel 10,000 pounds of coal, how many days will it take half of these ten people to shovel 40,000 pounds of coal?
Answer: The 10 people shovel 10,000 pounds per 10 days, or 10,000/10=<<10000/10=1000>>1000 pounds per day per 10 people.
And 1000 pounds per day per 10 people is 1000/10=<<1000/10=100>>100 pounds per day per person.
Half of ten people is 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5 people.
At 100 pounds per day per person, 5 people can shovel 5*100=<<5*100=500>>500 pounds per day.
Therefore, for 5 people to shovel 40,000 pounds, it will take 40,000/500=<<40000/500=80>>80 days.

Question: Davonte is trying to figure out how much space his art collection takes up. He measures his paintings and finds he has three square 6-foot by 6-foot paintings, four small 2-foot by 3-foot paintings, and one large 10-foot by 15-foot painting. How many square feet does his collection take up?
Answer: His square paintings take up 36 square feet each because 6 x 6 = <<6*6=36>>36
His small paintings take 6 square feet each because 2 x 3 = <<2*3=6>>6
His large painting takes up 150 square feet because 10 x 15 = <<10*15=150>>150.
Combined, his square paintings take up 108 square feet because 3 x 36 = <<3*36=108>>108
Combined, his small paintings take up 24 square feet because 4 x 6 = <<4*6=24>>24
In total, his paintings take up 282 square feet because 150 + 108 + 24 = <<150+108+24=282>>282
