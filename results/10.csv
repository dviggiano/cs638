Math,0,"Question: Jerry has a flock of chickens. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Every day Jerry collects 42 eggs. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?","Let's represent the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W.

We know that the red chickens produce 3 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs produced by red chickens is 3R.

Similarly, the white chickens produce 5 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs produced by white chickens is 5W.

We also know that Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, so we can write the equation:

3R + 5W = 42

We are also given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so we can write another equation:

W = R + 2

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to find the value of R:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42
3R + 5R + 10 = 42
8R = 32
R = 4

Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens in his flock.","First, set up the equation for the number of eggs the chickens lay each day: 3r + 5w = 42, where r is the number of red chickens and w is the number of white chickens.
Then, express r in terms of w based on the information in the problem: w = r + <<+2=2>>2
Now substitute r + 2 for w in the equation for the number of eggs: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
Now multiply 5 through the parentheses: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42
Now add like terms to get 8r + 10 = 42
Now subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 8r = 32
Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 8 to get r = 4

Question: There are 200 snakes in a park. There are three times as many pythons as boa constrictors. If there 40 boa constrictors and the rest of the snakes are rattlesnakes, calculate the total number of rattlesnakes in the park.
Answer: If the number of pythons is three times the number of boa constrictors, then there are 3*40 = <<3*40=120>>120 pythons
Together, the number of pythons and boa constrictors is 120+40 = <<120+40=160>>160
If there are 200 snakes in the park, the number of rattlesnakes is 200-160 = <<200-160=40>>40

Question: Jerry has a flock of chickens. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Every day Jerry collects 42 eggs. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?","Let the number of red chickens be represented by R, and the number of white chickens be represented by W.

Since the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, the total number of eggs produced by the red chickens in a day is 3R.

Since the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, the total number of eggs produced by the white chickens in a day is 5W.

Given that Jerry collects 42 eggs a day, we can write the equation:

3R + 5W = 42       ...(1)

Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, we can also write the equation:

W = R + 2          ...(2)

To find the number of red chickens, we need to solve the two equations simultaneously. Substituting equation (2) into equation (1), we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42
3R + 5R + 10 = 42
8R = 32
R = 4

Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

Math,1b,"Question: Rita is reading a five-chapter book with 95 pages. Each chapter has three pages more than the previous one. How many pages does the first chapter have?
Answer: Let P be the number of pages in the first chapter.
The second chapter has P + 3 pages.
The third chapter has P + 3 + 3 = P + <<+3+3=6>>6 pages.
The fourth chapter has P + 6 + 3 = P + <<+6+3=9>>9 pages.
The fifth chapter has P + 9 + 3 = P + <<+9+3=12>>12 pages.
The whole book has P + 3 + P + 6 + P + 9 + P + 12 = 5P + 30 = 95 pages.
Thus, without the 30 extra pages from additional chapters, 5P = 95 - 30 = 65 pages.
Therefore, the first chapter had P = 65 / 5 = <<65/5=13>>13 pages.

Question: Adam’s wardrobe is too crowded so he decides to donate some of his clothes to a charity shop. He takes out 4 pairs of pants, 4 jumpers, 4 pajama sets (top and bottom), and 20 t-shirts, then asks his friends if they have anything they want to donate. 3 of his friends donate the same amount of clothing as Adam each. Then he takes another look over his clothing and decides that he actually wants to keep half of his clothes. How many articles of clothing are being donated in total?
Answer: As pajama sets are made up of a top and a bottom, there are 4 pajama sets * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 articles of clothing from Adam's donation.
In total, Adam is donating 4 pairs of pants + 4 jumpers + 8 pajama pieces + 20 t-shirts = <<4+4+8+20=36>>36 articles of clothing.
Together, the 3 friends donate a total of 36 articles of clothing per friend * 3 friends = <<36*3=108>>108 articles of clothing.
Adam changes his mind and takes back half, which means he is now actually donating 36 / 2 = <<36/2=18>>18 articles of clothing.
There is therefore now a total of 108 + 18 = <<108+18=126>>126 articles of clothing being donated.
