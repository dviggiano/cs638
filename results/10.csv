Math,0,"Question: John is very tired. He decides to take a nap, but he wants to finish his homework first. If John has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework and 3 hours before he has to eat dinner, how many minutes does John have to nap?","To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to first calculate the total time he needs to finish his homework.

Total time for homework = 20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history)
Total time for homework = 80 minutes

Now, we need to subtract this total time from the time John has before dinner to find out how many minutes he has to nap.

Time before dinner = 3 hours = 3 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Minutes John has to nap = Time before dinner - Total time for homework
Minutes John has to nap = 180 minutes - 80 minutes
Minutes John has to nap = 100 minutes

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap before he has to eat dinner.","John has to spend 20+40+20 = <<20+40+20=80>>80 minutes on homework.
John has 3 hours*60 minutes= <<3*60=180>>180 minutes before dinner.
Thus, John has 180-80=<<180-80=100>>100 minutes for his nap.

Math,1a,"Question: Jordan read 120 French novels last holiday. His brother Alexandre read 1/10 of what Jordan read. How many more novels did Jordan read than Alexandre?
Answer: Alexandre read 120 * 1/10 = <<120*1/10=12>>12 novels.
So, Jordan read 120 - 12 = <<120-12=108>>108 novels more than Alexandre.

Question: Francie saves up her allowance for several weeks. She receives an allowance of $5 a week for 8 weeks. Then her dad raises her allowance, and she receives $6 a week for 6 weeks. Francie uses half of the money to buy new clothes. With the remaining money, she buys a video game that costs $35. How much money does Francie have remaining after buying the video game?
Answer: When her allowance is $5 a week, Francie gets a total of $5 * 8 = $<<5*8=40>>40
When her allowance is $6 a week, Francie gets a total of $6 * 6 = $<<6*6=36>>36
The total amount of money Francie gets is $40 + $36 = $<<40+36=76>>76
After purchasing new clothes, she has $76 / 2 = $<<76/2=38>>38 remaining
After buying the video game, Francie has $38 - $35 = $<<38-35=3>>3 remaining

Three hours is equal to 3 * 60 = <<3*60=180>>180 minutes.
Subtracting the time for homework, John has 180 - 80 = <<180-80=100>>100 minutes to nap.

Question: Carly is making burgers for a neighborhood BBQ. Each burger needs to be cooked for 4 minutes on each side. Carly can fit 5 burgers on the grill at once. If half her 30 guests want 2 burgers and the other half each want 1, how long will it take Carly to cook all the burgers?
Answer: First find half the number of guests at Carly's party: 30 guests / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 guests
Then multiply that number by 2 for the number of burgers half the guests want: 15 guests * 2 burgers/guest = <<15*2=30>>30 burgers
Then add the 15 burgers for the 15 guests who only want 1 to find the total number of burgers: 30 burgers + 15 burgers = 45 burgers
Then divide the total number of burgers by the number of burgers Carly can cook at once to find the number of batches she cooks: 45 burgers / 5 burgers/batch = <<45/5=9>>9 batches
Then multiply the number of sides per burger by the cooking time per side to find each burger's total cook time: 4 minutes/side * 2 sides = <<4*2=8>>8 minutes
Finally, multiply each batch's cook time by the number of batches to find the total cook time: 8 minutes/batch * 9 batches = <<8*9=72>>72 minutes

Next, convert 3 hours into minutes: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes
Subtract the time needed to finish homework from the total time John has before dinner: 180 minutes - 80 minutes = <<180-80=100>>100 minutes
