Math,1a,"Question: John builds a box.  The box is 26 inches by 26 inches by 14 inches.  The walls are 1 inch thick on each side.  How much is the internal volume in cubic feet?
Answer: The walls take away 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 inches from each dimension
So the longer sides are 26-2=<<26-2=24>>24 inches
That is 24/12=<<24/12=2>>2 feet
The smaller dimension is 14-2=<<14-2=12>>12 inches
That is 12/12=<<12/12=1>>1 foot
So the internal volume is 2*2*1=<<2*2*1=4>>4 cubic feet

Question: Frank's laundry detergent is double concentrated and will wash 80 loads of laundry.  His detergent is usually $25.00 a bottle but they're having a sale.  If he buys 2 bottles, both bottles will drop to $20.00 a bottle.  How much does he spend, in cents, per load of laundry, if he buys 2 bottles of detergent?
Answer: If he buys 2 bottles, the price drops to $20.00 per bottle so they cost 2*20 = $<<2*20=40.00>>40.00
He can get 80 loads of laundry per bottle and he bought 2 bottles so that's 80*2 = <<80*2=160>>160 loads of laundry
The detergent cost $40.00 and he will be able to wash 160 loads of laundry so each load costs 40/160 = $<<40/160=0.25>>0.25

Question: Maggie's oven is malfunctioning. When she sets it to 450 the actual temperature is 468. If it's off by the same percentage for any recipe, what temperature should she set it at if her recipe calls for 520 degrees?","Answer: The oven is off by 468 - 450 = <<468-450=18>>18 degrees.
This is a percentage increase of 18/450 * 100% = <<18/450*100>>4%.
If her recipe calls for 520 degrees, she should set the oven to 520 + 4% of 520 = 520 + 0.04 * 520 = 520 + <<520*0.04=20.8>>20.8 = <<520+520*0.04=540.8>>540.8 degrees.","The oven off by 18 degrees because 468 - 450 = <<468-450=18>>18
The oven is off by 4% because 18 / 450 x 100 = <<18/450*100=4>>4%
Therefore X + .04X = 520
Therefore 1.04X = 520
The temperature to set it is 500 because 520 / 1.04 = <<520/1.04=500>>500

Math,1a,"Question: Rebecca makes her own earrings out of buttons, magnets, and gemstones.  For every earring, she uses two magnets, half as many buttons as magnets, and three times as many gemstones as buttons.  If Rebecca wants to make 4 sets of earrings, how many gemstones will she need?
Answer: Four sets of earrings is 2*4=<<2*4=8>>8 earrings.
Since for one earring, she uses two magnets, for eight earrings she uses 2*8=<<2*8=16>>16 magnets.
Since she uses half as many buttons as magnets, then for 8 earrings she would use 16/2=8 buttons.
Since she uses three times as many gemstones as buttons, then in 8 earrings, she will use 8*3=<<24=24>>24 gemstones.

Question: Ibrahim wants to buy an MP3 player for 120 euros and a CD for 19 euros. He has 55 euros in savings. His father participates in his purchase by giving him 20 euros. How much money does Ibrahim lack?
Answer: The total price of the purchases is 120 + 19 = <<120+19=139>>139 euros.
The amount of money he has after his father's help is 55 + 20 = <<55+20=75>>75 euros.
The purchase amount is 139 euros, so he is missing 139 – 75 = <<139-75=64>>64 euros.

Question: Maggie's oven is malfunctioning. When she sets it to 450 the actual temperature is 468. If it's off by the same percentage for any recipe, what temperature should she set it at if her recipe calls for 520 degrees?","Answer: The percentage error is (468-450) / 450 * 100% = 4%.
To find the temperature she should set for 520 degrees with the same percentage error, she should set it at 520 * (1 + 0.04) = 540.8 degrees.
Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 540.8 degrees for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees.","The oven off by 18 degrees because 468 - 450 = <<468-450=18>>18

This is an error of (18/450) * 100 = 4%.
To calculate the correct temperature to set for 520 degrees, she should increase it by 4%.
4% of 520 is (4/100) * 520 = 20.8.

Question: Maggie's oven is malfunctioning. When she sets it to 450 the actual temperature is 468. If it's off by the same percentage for any recipe, what temperature should she set it at if her recipe calls for 520 degrees?","To find the correct setting for Maggie's oven, we need to calculate the percentage error first.

Percentage error = ((actual temperature - set temperature) / set temperature) * 100
Percentage error = ((468 - 450) / 450) * 100
Percentage error = (18 / 450) * 100
Percentage error = 0.04 * 100
Percentage error = 4%

Now that we know the percentage error is 4%, we can calculate the correct setting for 520 degrees.

Correct temperature = set temperature / (1 + error percentage)
Correct temperature = 520 / (1 + 0.04)
Correct temperature = 520 / 1.04
Correct temperature = <<499.03=520/1.04>>499.03 degrees

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 499 degrees if her recipe calls for 520 degrees.","The oven off by 18 degrees because 468 - 450 = <<468-450=18>>18
The oven is off by 4% because 18 / 450 x 100 = <<18/450*100=4>>4%
Therefore X + .04X = 520
