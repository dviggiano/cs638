Math,1a,"Question: Logan's father receives 50 cartons delivery for his milk business, each carton having 20 jars of milk. On a particular week, he received 20 cartons less when the delivery was done, and during offloading, he realized 3 jars in 5 cartons each was damaged, and one carton was totally damaged. How many jars of milk were good for sale that week?
Answer: When 20 cartons failed to be delivered, the number of cartons reduced to 50-20 = <<50-20=30>>30 cartons.
The total number of jars in all the cartons is 30*20 = <<30*20=600>>600
The total number of jars destroyed in the 5 cartons is 3*5 = <<3*5=15>>15 jars.
If one carton was also destroyed, the total number of destroyed jars is 20+15 = <<20+15=35>>35 jars.
The number of jars good for sale is 600-35 = <<600-35=565>>565 jars.

Question: Ali and Sara ate 80 small apples combined. Ali ate 4 times more apples than Sara. How many apples did Sara eat?
Answer: Let A be the number of apples Ali ate and S be the number of apples Sara ate.
We have: A + S = 80 apples
And: A = <<4=4>>4S
Which means: 4S + S = 80
So: 5S = 80
So the number of apples Sara ate is: S = 80 / 5= <<80/5=16>>16 apples

Q: David and Dasha went to the carnival, where there are 9 rides.  Each ride costs 2 ride tickets at $2 per ticket.  You can also buy a ride bracelet for $30 which gives you 9 rides.  If David buys a ride bracelet and Dasha buys tickets, and they ride all 9 rides, how much money does David save?","A ride bracelet gives David 9 rides for $30, so each ride costs $30 / 9 = $<<30/9=3.33>>3.33 with the bracelet.
Dasha buys 2 ride tickets per ride for $2 each, so each ride costs her 2 * 2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.
So, David saves 4 - 3.33 = $<<4-3.33=0.67>>0.67 per ride by using the ride bracelet.
Since they both ride all 9 rides, David saves a total of 9 * 0.67 = $<<9*0.67=6.03>>6.03.
Therefore, David saves $6.03 in total.","Each ride cost 2 x $2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.
All 9 rides cost $4 x 9 = $<<4*9=36>>36.
By bathing the ride bracelet, David saves $36 - $30 = $<<36-30=6>>6.

Math,1a,"Question: Gabrielle sells eggs. On Monday she sells 5 crates of eggs. On Tuesday she sells 2 times as many crates of eggs as Monday. On Wednesday she sells 2 fewer crates than Tuesday. On Thursday she sells half as many crates of eggs as she sells on Tuesday. How many total crates of eggs does she sell for the 4 days?
Answer: On Tuesday she sells 5 crates * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 crates of eggs.
On Wednesday she sells 10 crates - 2 crates = <<10-2=8>>8 crates of eggs.
On Thursday she sells 1/2 * 10 crates = <<1/2*10=5>>5 crates of eggs.
She sells a total of 5 crates + 10 crates + 8 crates + 5 crates = <<5+10+8+5=28>>28 crates of eggs.

Question: Antonia is trying to improve her health by buying supplements. She has a 7-day pill box she wants to fill. She buys 5 different supplements. 3 of the bottles have 120 pills in them each. 2 of the bottles have 30 pills each. After Antonia has filled her pillbox with one pill of each supplement for 2 weeks, how many pills total does she have left from all 5 bottles?
Answer: Antonia buys 5 different supplements where 3 bottles have 120 pills per bottle, so she has 120 pills x 3 bottles = 360 pills.
2 of the bottles Antonia buys have 30 pills each x 2 bottles = <<30*2=60>>60 pills.
She has purchased 360 pills + 60 pills = <<360+60=420>>420 pills total in the 5 bottles.
Antonia has filled her 7-day pill box for 2 weeks, so 7 days x 2 weeks = <<7*2=14>>14 days.
On each of the 14 days she fills it with 5 pills, so after 14 days she has used 14 x 5 = <<14*5=70>>70 pills.
Since Antonia had 420 total pills in all 5 bottles and then she fills her pillbox with 70 pills, she has 420 - 70 = <<420-70=350>>350 pills.
Antonia will have 350 pills left after 2 weeks.

Q: David and Dasha went to the carnival, where there are 9 rides.  Each ride costs 2 ride tickets at $2 per ticket.  You can also buy a ride bracelet for $30 which gives you 9 rides.  If David buys a ride bracelet and Dasha buys tickets, and they ride all 9 rides, how much money does David save?","A: If David buys a ride bracelet, he pays $30 for 9 rides, which means he is effectively paying $30 / 9 = $3.33 per ride.
Dasha buys tickets at $2 per ticket and each ride costs 2 tickets, so she pays 2 tickets * 2 = $4 per ride.
The difference in price per ride between David and Dasha is $4 - $3.33 = $0.67.
Since they ride all 9 rides, David saves $0.67 per ride * 9 rides = $6.03 in total compared to Dasha.","Each ride cost 2 x $2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.
All 9 rides cost $4 x 9 = $<<4*9=36>>36.
By bathing the ride bracelet, David saves $36 - $30 = $<<36-30=6>>6.

Answer: Antonia buys 5 different supplements where 3 bottles have 120 pills per bottle, so she has 120 pills x 3 bottles = 360 pills.
2 of the bottles Antonia buys have 30 pills each x 2 bottles = <<30*2=60>>60 pills.
She has purchased 360 pills + 60 pills = <<360+60=420>>420 pills total in the 5 bottles.
Antonia has filled her 7-day pill box for 2 weeks, so 7 days x 2 weeks = <<7*2=14>>14 days.
On each of the 14 days she fills it with 5 pills, so after 14 days she has used 14 x 5 = <<14*5=70>>70 pills.
Since Antonia had 420 total pills in all 5 bottles and then she fills her pillbox with 70 pills, she has 420 - 70 = <<420-70=350>>350 pills.

Q: David and Dasha went to the carnival, where there are 9 rides.  Each ride costs 2 ride tickets at $2 per ticket.  You can also buy a ride bracelet for $30 which gives you 9 rides.  If David buys a ride bracelet and Dasha buys tickets, and they ride all 9 rides, how much money does David save?","A ride bracelet costs $30 and gives access to all 9 rides, which is equivalent to buying 9 * $2 = $18 worth of ride tickets.
If Dasha buys 9 ride tickets at $2 each, she would spend 9 * $2 = $18.
Therefore, David saves $18 - $30 = $12 by buying a ride bracelet instead of individual ride tickets. 
So, David saves $12.","Each ride cost 2 x $2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.
All 9 rides cost $4 x 9 = $<<4*9=36>>36.

Dasha buys 9 ride tickets at $2 each, so she spends 9 * 2 = $18 on tickets.
