Math,0,Question: Ryan’s allowance is $6 each week he completes his chores. He did his chores for 3 weeks. Then he bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each. Now they all want to go to the movies and tickets cost $6.50 each. How many movie tickets can Ryan buy?,"Ryan earned $6 for each of the 3 weeks he completed his chores, so his total allowance is $6 x 3 = $18.

He spent $1.25 x 4 = $5 on ice cream cones for himself and his 3 friends.

After buying ice cream, Ryan has $18 - $5 = $13 left.

Ryan has $18 - $5 = $<<18-5=13>>13 left.

Math,1b,"Question: Kim's TV uses 125 watts of electricity per hour.  She runs it for 4 hours a day.  If electricity cost 14 cents per kw/h how many cents does her TV cost to run for a week?
Answer: She uses 4 hours/day * 125 watts/hour=<<4*125=500>>500 watt hours/day
That means she uses 500 watt hours/day * 7 days/week = <<500*7=3500>>3500 watt hours/week

StrategyQA,0,"Question: Hostas are characterized by large green striped leaves. The green color in plants is attributed to chlorophyll. 
For Hostas to look their best, do they need lots of chlorophyll?","Yes, hostas do require chlorophyll in order to thrive and achieve their characteristic large green striped leaves. Chlorophyll is responsible for the green color in plants and is essential for photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy. Adequate chlorophyll production in hostas is important for healthy growth and optimal photosynthesis, thus contributing to the plant's overall appearance and vigor. However, excessive chlorophyll levels can sometimes lead to issues like yellowing or browning of leaves, so it is important to provide the right amount of sunlight, water, and nutrients for the hostas to maintain their green color and health.",True
