Math,0,"Question: The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. If the 3 ropes had a combined length of 37 centimeters, what was the length of the red rope in centimeters?","Let's represent the length of the blue rope as x centimeters. 

Since the red rope was four times the length of the blue rope, its length would be 4x centimeters. 

Given that the blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, we can represent the length of the yellow rope as x + 7 centimeters.

The combined length of the 3 ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x + (x + 7) = 37
6x + 7 = 37
6x = 30
x = 5

Therefore, the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters, the red rope is 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters, and the yellow rope is 5 + 7 = 12 centimeters. 

Therefore, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.","Let Y = the length of the yellow rope in centimeters
Blue rope = Y - 7
Red rope = 4 * (Y - 7)
Y + Y - 7 + 4 (Y - 7) = 37 cm
6Y - 35 = 37
6Y = 72
Y = <<12=12>>12 cm
The red rope was 20 cm long.

Math,1a,"Question: Annie plants 3 pots of basil, 9 pots of rosemary, and 6 pots of thyme. Each basil plant has 4 leaves, each rosemary plant has 18 leaves, and each thyme plant has 30 leaves. How many leaves are there total?
Answer: First find the total number of basil leaves: 3 pots * 4 leaves/pot = <<3*4=12>>12 leaves
Then find the total number of rosemary leaves: 9 pots * 18 leaves/pot = <<9*18=162>>162 leaves
Then find the total number of thyme leaves: 6 pots * 30 leaves/pot = <<6*30=180>>180 leaves
Then add the number of each type of leaf to find the total number of leaves: 12 leaves + 162 leaves + 180 leaves = <<12+162+180=354>>354 leaves

Question: The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. If the 3 ropes had a combined length of 37 centimeters, what was the length of the red rope in centimeters?","Let's represent the length of the blue rope as x centimeters.

Since the red rope was four times the length of the blue rope, the red rope's length is 4x centimeters.

Since the blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, the yellow rope's length is x + 7 centimeters.

The total length of all 3 ropes is x + 4x + x + 7 = 37.

Combining like terms, we get 6x + 7 = 37.

Subtracting 7 from both sides, we get 6x = 30.

Dividing by 6, we find x = 5.

Therefore, the length of the red rope is 4 * x = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters.","Let Y = the length of the yellow rope in centimeters
Blue rope = Y - 7
Red rope = 4 * (Y - 7)
Y + Y - 7 + 4 (Y - 7) = 37 cm
6Y - 35 = 37
6Y = 72
Y = <<12=12>>12 cm
The red rope was 20 cm long.

Math,1b,"Question: Christian and Sue wanted to get a $50.00 bottle of perfume for their mom for her birthday.  Christian had $5.00 saved up and Sue had $7.00.  Christian then mowed 4 of his neighbors' yards, charging $5.00 each, while Sue walked 6 dogs for her neighbors, charging $2.00 per dog.  How much more money will Christian and Sue need to make in order to buy the bottle of perfume for their mom?
Answer: Christian just mowed 4 yards at $5.00 each so he made 4*5 = $<<4*5=20.00>>20.00
Sue just walked 6 dogs at $2.00 each so she made 6*2 = $<<6*2=12.00>>12.00
Christian had $5.00 saved and just made $20.00 while Sue had $7.00 saved and just made $12.00 so together they had 5+20+7+12 = $<<5+20+7+12=44>>44

Question: Mr. Shaefer harvested 500 lychees in a carton and took them to the market. He sold half of them and took home the remaining number of lychees where they ate 3/5 of them. Calculate the number of lychees remaining.
Answer: At the market, Mr. Shaefer sold half of the lychees, which is 1/2*500 = 250
The remaining number of lychees is 500-250 = <<500-250=250>>250
At home, they ate 3/5*250 = <<3/5*250=150>>150 lychees.
The total number of lychees remaining is 250-150 = <<250-150=100>>100

Question: The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. If the 3 ropes had a combined length of 37 centimeters, what was the length of the red rope in centimeters?","Let x be the length of the blue rope.

The red rope was 4 times the length of the blue rope, so it was 4x.

The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the yellow rope was x + 7.

The total length of the 3 ropes is x + 4x + (x + 7) = 37.

Combining like terms, we get 6x + 7 = 37.

Subtracting 7 from both sides, we get 6x = 30.

Dividing by 6, we get x = 5.

Therefore, the length of the red rope, which is 4 times the length of the blue rope, is 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters.","Let Y = the length of the yellow rope in centimeters
Blue rope = Y - 7

Question: The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. If the 3 ropes had a combined length of 37 centimeters, what was the length of the red rope in centimeters?","Answer: Let's start by defining variables for the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the red rope as 4B, and the length of the yellow rope as B+7. 
Since the combined length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters, we can set up the equation B + 4B + (B+7) = 37
Combining like terms gives 6B + 7 = 37
Subtracting 7 from both sides gives 6B = 30
