Math,1a,"Question: Whitney bought 9 books about whales and 7 books about fish. She also bought 3 magazines. Each book cost $11 and each magazine cost $1. How much did Whitney spend in all?
Answer: The total number of books is 9 books + 7 books = <<9+7=16>>16 books.
The cost of the books is $11/book × 16 books = $<<11*16=176>>176.
The cost of the magazines is $1/magazine × 3 magazines = $<<1*3=3>>3.
Whitney spent $3 + $176 = $<<3+176=179>>179 in all.

Question: Johnson has a sack of potatoes. He gives Gina 69 potatoes, gives Tom twice as much potatoes as he gave Gina and gives one-third of the amount of potatoes he gave Tom to Anne. How many potatoes does he have left if the sack contains 300 potatoes?
Answer: He gives twice 69 potatoes to Tom, which is 69*2 = <<69*2=138>>138 potatoes
He gives one-third of 138 potatoes to Anne, which is 138*(1/3) = <<138*(1/3)=46>>46 potatoes
In total, he has given out 69+138+46 = <<69+138+46=253>>253 potatoes
He initially had 300 potatoes so he now has 300-253 = <<300-253=47>>47 potatoes left

Question: A football team played 22 games. They won 8 more than they lost. How many did they win?","Let x be the number of games the team lost.
They won 8 more than they lost, so they won x + 8 games.
The total number of games played is the sum of the games they won and lost, which is x + (x + 8) = 22.
This simplifies to 2x + 8 = 22.
Subtracting 8 from both sides gives 2x = 14.
Dividing by 2, we find x = 7.
Therefore, the team won x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15 games.
The team won 15 games.","Let L be the number of losses.
The number of wins is L + <<+8=8>>8.
The team played (L+8) + L = 2L + 8 = 22 games.
So, 2L = 22 - 8 = 14
So L = 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 losses.
Therefore, the team won 22 – 7 = <<22-7=15>>15 games.

Math,1a,"Question: Laura loves to cook. One day she decided to make dinner for her family. She bought the necessary ingredients for this occasion: two salads, 2 kilograms of beef, 1 kilogram of potatoes, and two liters of juice. One salad costs $3, and one kilogram of beef is two times more expensive. One kilogram of potatoes costs one-third of the price of one salad, and one liter of juice is $1.5. How much did Laura need to pay for all the products she bought?
Answer: Laura bought two salads, for 2 * 3 = $<<2*3=6>>6.
One kilogram of beef is two times more expensive than one salad, which means it cost 2 * 3 = $6.
So Laura spend 2 * 6 = $<<2*6=12>>12 on beef.
One kilogram of potatoes costs only 3 * 1/3 = $<<3*1/3=1>>1, and that's how much Laura paid for potatoes.
Laura bought two liters of juice, so she did spend on them 2 * 1.5 = $<<2*1.5=3>>3.
So in total Laura paid 6 + 12 + 1 + 3 = $<<6+12+1+3=22>>22.

Question: Kimiko watches four YouTube videos. The first video is 2 minutes long, the second video is 4 minutes and 30 seconds, and the last two videos are equal in length. If she spends a total of 510 seconds watching YouTube, how many seconds long was each of the last two videos?
Answer: First convert the length of the first video to seconds: 2 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = <<2*60=120>>120 seconds
Then convert the length of the second video to seconds: 4 minutes * 60 seconds/minute + 30 seconds = 240 seconds + 30 seconds = <<4*60+30=270>>270 seconds
Now subtract the length of the first two videos from the total time Kimiko spent watching to find the combined length of the last two videos: 510 seconds - 120 seconds - 270 seconds = <<510-120-270=120>>120 seconds
Now divide the combined length by the number of videos to find each video's length: 120 seconds / 2 = <<120/2=60>>60 seconds

Question: A football team played 22 games. They won 8 more than they lost. How many did they win?","Answer: Let's denote the number of games the team lost as x. Therefore, the number of games they won is x + 8. The total number of games played is 22, so we can create an equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22
2x + 8 = 22
2x = 14
x = 7

Therefore, the team lost 7 games and won 7 + 8 = 15 games.
#### 15","Let L be the number of losses.
The number of wins is L + <<+8=8>>8.
The team played (L+8) + L = 2L + 8 = 22 games.
So, 2L = 22 - 8 = 14
So L = 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 losses.
Therefore, the team won 22 – 7 = <<22-7=15>>15 games.

Question: A football team played 22 games. They won 8 more than they lost. How many did they win?","Let x be the number of games the team lost.

The number of games they won is x + 8.

The total number of games played is the sum of games won and games lost, which is x + (x + 8) = 22.

Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 22.

Subtracting 8 from both sides gives 2x = 14.

Dividing by 2, we get x = 7, which is the number of games the team lost.

Therefore, the number of games they won is 7 + 8 = 15. 

So, they won 15 games.","Let L be the number of losses.
The number of wins is L + <<+8=8>>8.
