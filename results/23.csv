Math,0,Question: Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.  He works 2 hours less than he sleeps and he walks his dog for an hour each day.  How much free time does Harold have left in his day?,"Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night, works for 8 hours (2 hours less than he sleeps), and walks his dog for 1 hour each day. 

So, Harold's total time for sleeping, working, and walking his dog is 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, Harold's free time is 24 - 19 = 5 hours. 

Therefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day.","He works 2 hours less than he sleeps and he sleeps for 10 hours so he works 10-2 = <<10-2=8>>8 hours
He sleeps for 10 hours, works for 8 hours and walks his dog for 1 hour for a total of 10+8+1 = <<10+8+1=19>>19 hours
There are 24 hours in a day and his busy for 19 hours so that leaves 24-19 = <<24-19=5>>5 hours left of free time

Math,1a,"Question: John is working as an IT specialist. He repairs broken computers. One day he had to fix 20 computers. 20% of them were unfixable, and 40% of them needed to wait a few days for spare parts to come. The rest John was able to fix right away. How many computers John was able to fix right away?
Answer: From all the computers, 100% - 40% - 20% = 40% got fixed right away.
So John was able to fix 40/100 * 20 = <<40/100*20=8>>8 computers.

Question: To make a living, Carl needs to drive a car for 2 hours every day. After he got promoted he needs to drive for 6 more hours every week. How many hours will Carl drive in two weeks?
Answer: Every week Carl needs to drive additional 6 hours, so in two weeks that would make 2 * 6 = <<2*6=12>>12 additional hours.
Two weeks of driving 2 hours every day, means 14 * 2 = <<14*2=28>>28 hours of driving.
So during two weeks, Carl will drive 28 + 12 = <<28+12=40>>40 hours.

Math,1b,"Question: Every Halloween one house in the neighborhood gives out toothbrushes instead of candy, so it always gets egged and covered in toilet paper. If the owner spends 15 seconds cleaning up each egg and 30 minutes cleaning up each roll of toilet paper, how long (in minutes) will they have to spend cleaning up 60 eggs and 7 rolls of toilet paper?
Answer: First find how many eggs per minute the owner can clean up: 60 seconds/minute / 15 seconds/egg = <<60/15=4>>4 eggs/minute
Then divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs cleaned per minute to find how long the owner spends cleaning them up: 60 eggs / 4 eggs/minute = <<60/4=15>>15 minutes
Then find the total time the owner spends cleaning up toilet paper: 7 rolls * 30 minutes/roll = <<7*30=210>>210 minutes
Finally, add that amount to the egg cleaning time to find the total cleaning time: 210 minutes + 15 minutes = <<210+15=225>>225 minutes

Adding the hour he walks his dog, Harold spends 8 + 1 = <<8+1=9>>9 hours on these activities.

Question: Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.  He works 2 hours less than he sleeps and he walks his dog for an hour each day.  How much free time does Harold have left in his day?","To find how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to calculate how many hours he sleeps, works, walks his dog, and then subtract that total from 24 (total hours in a day).

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night, works 2 hours less than he sleeps (10 - 2 = 8 hours), and walks his dog for 1 hour.

So, the total time Harold spends on these activities is 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking the dog) = 19 hours.

Harold has 24 hours in a day, so to find his free time, we subtract the total time spent on activities from 24:

24 - 19 = 5 hours

Therefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day.","He works 2 hours less than he sleeps and he sleeps for 10 hours so he works 10-2 = <<10-2=8>>8 hours
