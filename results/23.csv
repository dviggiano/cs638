Math,1a,"Question: Bob can shuck 10 oysters in 5 minutes.  How many oysters can he shuck in 2 hours?
Answer: He shucks 10 oysters in 5 minutes we need to know how many 5 minute units are in 60 minutes so 60/5 = 12 units
He can shuck 10 oysters in 5 minutes and there are 12 5 minute units in an hour so he can shuck 10*12 = <<10*12=120>>120 oysters in 1 hour
If he can shuck 120 oysters in 1 hour, so for 2 hours in can shuck 2*120 = 240 oysters

Q: Alice is 7 years older than Beth, who is 5 years older than Erica. What is the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, if Erica is 30 years old?","Let's start by finding out how old Beth is since we know Erica's age:
Beth is 30 years old - 5 years = 25 years old
Next, we find out Alice's age since we know Beth's age:
Alice is 25 years old + 7 years = 32 years old
Now, we can find the difference between Alice and Erica's ages:
32 years - 30 years = 2 years
The difference between Alice and Erica's ages is 2 years.","Beth is 30+5 = <<30+5=35>>35 years old.
Alice is 35+7 = <<35+7=42>>42 years old.
The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 42-30 = <<42-30=12>>12 years.

Math,1a,"Question: Each bank teller has 10 rolls of coins. Each roll has 25 coins. How many coins do four bank tellers have in all?
Answer: Each bank teller has 10 x 25 = <<10*25=250>>250 coins.
Thus, four bank tellers have 250 x 4 = <<250*4=1000>>1000 coins.

Q: Alice is 7 years older than Beth, who is 5 years older than Erica. What is the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, if Erica is 30 years old?","First, we need to figure out Beth's age. Since Beth is 5 years older than Erica, Beth is 30 + 5 = 35 years old.

Next, we need to determine Alice's age. Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, Alice is 35 + 7 = 42 years old.

Finally, we can find the difference between Alice and Erica's ages by subtracting Erica's age from Alice's age: 42 - 30 = 12.

Therefore, the difference in age between Alice and Erica is 12 years.","Beth is 30+5 = <<30+5=35>>35 years old.
Alice is 35+7 = <<35+7=42>>42 years old.
The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 42-30 = <<42-30=12>>12 years.
