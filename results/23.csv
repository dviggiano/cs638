Math,1a,"Question: A construction company is building 2 apartment buildings with 12 floors each. The apartments are almost ready to sell but all of them need doors to be completed. Each floor has 6 apartments, and each apartment needs 7 doors in total. How many doors does the company need to buy?
Answer: The number of floors is 12 floors/building x 2 buildings = 24 floors
The number of apartments is 6 apartments/floor x 24 floors = <<6*24=144>>144 apartments
The company has to buy 7 doors/apartment x 144 apartments = <<7*144=1008>>1008 doors

Question: 1,800 fish swim westward, 3,200 swim eastward, and 500 swim north. What is the number of fish left in the sea, if fishers catch 2/5 of the fish that swam eastward and 3/4 of the fish that swam westward?
Answer: When fishers caught 3/4 of the fish that swam westward, their total number reduced by 3/4 * 1800 fish = <<3/4*1800=1350>>1350
The total number of fish that remained from the total number that swam eastward is 1800 fish - 1350 fish = <<1800-1350=450>>450 fish
If fishers caught 2/5 of the fish that swam eastward, their total number reduced by 2/5 * 3200 fish = <<2/5*3200=1280>>1280 fish
3200 fish - 1280 fish = <<3200-1280=1920>>1920 fish remained in the sea from the number that swam westward.
The total number of fish in the sea after fishers caught some is 500 of the number that went north + 450 of the fish that swam westward + 1920 of the fish that swam eastward = <<500+450+1920=2870>>2870 fish

Question: James gets a job selling used cars.  He sold 10 cars that cost $25,000 each.  The company paid 30% of that price to acquire the cars.  He got a 10% commission on the profits.  How much did he make?","First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars: 10 cars * $25,000/car = $250,000

Next, let's calculate the amount the company paid to acquire the cars: $250,000 * 30% = $75,000

Now, let's calculate the total profit made from selling the cars: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

Next, let's calculate the commission James received for the profits: $175,000 * 10% = $17,500

Therefore, James made $17,500 from selling the used cars.","He sold the car for 25000*10=$<<25000*10=250000>>250,000
Each car was bought for 25,000*.3=$<<25000*.3=7500>>7500
So they bought the cars for 7500*10=$<<7500*10=75000>>75,000
That means the cars had a profit of 250,000-75,000=$<<250000-75000=175000>>175,000
So his commission was 175,000*.1=$<<175000*.1=17500>>17,500

Math,1a,"Question: Jimmy is setting up a garden. He has three plots: one plot for green beans, one plot for carrots, and one plot for corn. Each corn plant produces 5 times as many servings of veggies as each carrot, and each green bean plant produces half as many servings as each corn plant. If each carrot produces 4 servings of vegetables, and each plot has 9 plants, how many servings of vegetables is Jimmy growing?
Answer: First, find how many servings one corn plant produces by multiplying the number of carrot servings by 5: 4 servings * 5 = <<4*5=20>>20 servings
Then find how many servings one green bean plant produces by dividing the number of corn servings by two: 20 servings / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10 servings
Now multiply the number of servings per carrot plant by the number of carrot plants: 4 servings/plant * 9 plants = <<4*9=36>>36 servings
Do the same for corn: 20 servings/plant * 9 plants = <<20*9=180>>180 servings
And do the same for green beans: 10 servings/plant * 9 plants = <<10*9=90>>90 servings
Now add up the servings for all three types of plant: 36 servings + 180 servings + 90 servings = <<36+180+90=306>>306 servings

Question: Kiaan is doing home delivery of newspapers in his neighborhood of 200 homes. After an hour of work, he has distributed newspapers to 2/5 of the homes. After another 2 hours of working, he realizes he has distributed newspapers to 60 percent of the remaining homes. How many homes does he still need to distribute the newspapers to?
Answer: After the first hour of work, he has distributed newspapers to 2/5*200 = <<2/5*200=80>>80 homes
The number of homes that still need newspapers is 200-80 = <<200-80=120>>120
Two hours later, the number of homes he has distributed newspapers to is 60/100 * 120 = <<60/100*120=72>>72 homes.
The number of homes he still needs to distribute newspapers to is 120-72 = <<120-72=48>>48 homes

The company paid 30% of that cost, which is $250,000 * 0.30 = $75,000.
This means that the profit made was $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.
James received a 10% commission on the profit, so he made $175,000 * 0.10 = $17,500.
Therefore, James made $17,500 selling the used cars.","He sold the car for 25000*10=$<<25000*10=250000>>250,000
Each car was bought for 25,000*.3=$<<25000*.3=7500>>7500
So they bought the cars for 7500*10=$<<7500*10=75000>>75,000
That means the cars had a profit of 250,000-75,000=$<<250000-75000=175000>>175,000
So his commission was 175,000*.1=$<<175000*.1=17500>>17,500

The company paid 30% of that price, so the cost to acquire the cars was 30% * $250,000 = $75,000.
This means the profit made from selling the cars is $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.
James got a 10% commission on the profits, so he made 10% * $175,000 = $17,500.

10 cars * $25,000/car = $250,000

Next, let's calculate how much James made from the commission on the profits:
The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, so the remaining amount is 100% - 30% = 70%.
The company made a profit of 70% of $250,000 = 0.70 * $250,000 = $175,000
James received a 10% commission on the profits, so he made 10% of $175,000 = 0.10 * $175,000 = $17,500

Therefore, James made $17,500 from selling the 10 cars.","He sold the car for 25000*10=$<<25000*10=250000>>250,000
