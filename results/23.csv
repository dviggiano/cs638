Math,0,"Question: Jackie grew 3"" over the summer.  She is now 2"" shorter than Anne, who is twice the size of Albert.  If Albert is 36"" tall, how tall was Jackie before summer?","First, we need to find out how tall Anne is currently. Since Anne is 2"" taller than Jackie, Anne's height is 3"" + 2"" = 5"" taller than Jackie.

So, if Jackie is now 5"" shorter than Anne, Anne's height is 3"" + 5"" = 8"" tall.

Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, Anne's height equals 2 * Albert's height. We know that Albert is 36"" tall, so Anne's height is 2 * 36"" = 72"".

Now, we know that Anne's height is 8"", so 72"" = 8"", which means that 1 inch is equal to 72"" / 8 = 9"".

Before the summer, Jackie was 3"" shorter than Anne, so Jackie's height was 8"" - 3"" = 5"".

Since 5"" is Jackie's current height, we can calculate Jackie's height before the summer by subtracting the growth over the summer, which is 3"", so Jackie's height before the summer was 5"" - 3"" = 2"".","Anne is twice the size of Albert, who is 36"", so Anne is 2*36 = <<72=72>>72"" tall
Anne is 72"" tall and Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so Jackie is 72-2 = <<72-2=70>>70"" tall
Jackie is currently 70"" tall and grew 3"" over summer, so before summer she was 70-3= <<70-3=67>>67"" tall

Math,1a,"Question: The big bottles of mango juice hold 30 ounces and cost 2700 pesetas each. The small bottles hold 6 ounces and cost 600 pesetas each. How many pesetas would be saved by buying a big bottle instead of smaller bottles for the same volume of juice?
Answer: The equivalent is 30/6=<<30/6=5>>5 small bottles.
Five small bottles at 600 pesetas each is 5*600=<<5*600=3000>>3000 pesetas.
The savings is 3000-2700=<<3000-2700=300>>300.

Question: Jackie grew 3"" over the summer.  She is now 2"" shorter than Anne, who is twice the size of Albert.  If Albert is 36"" tall, how tall was Jackie before summer?","Step 1: Find Anne's height.
Anne is twice the size of Albert, so Anne is 2 * 36 = 72 inches tall.

Step 2: Find Jackie's height after growing.
Jackie grew 3 inches, so she is now 72 - 2 = 70 inches tall.

Step 3: Find Jackie's height before the summer.
Before the summer, Jackie was 70 - 3 = 67 inches tall. 

Jackie was 67 inches tall before the summer.","Anne is twice the size of Albert, who is 36"", so Anne is 2*36 = <<72=72>>72"" tall
Anne is 72"" tall and Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so Jackie is 72-2 = <<72-2=70>>70"" tall
Jackie is currently 70"" tall and grew 3"" over summer, so before summer she was 70-3= <<70-3=67>>67"" tall

Math,1b,"Question: James has an old printer that crumples every seventh page and blurs the ink on every third page. If he prints 42 pages, how many are neither crumpled or blurred?
Answer: First find the total number of pages that are crumpled: 42 pages / 7 = <<42/7=6>>6 pages
Then find the total number of pages that are blurred: 42 pages / 3 = <<42/3=14>>14 pages
Then find the number of pages that are both blurred and crumpled by finding how many numbers are less or equal to 42 and divisible by both 3 and 7: there are two, 21 and 42.
Then subtract the number of crumpled and blurred pages from the total number of pages, and add the number of pages that were double-counted because they were both blurred and crumpled: 42 pages - 6 pages - 14 pages + 2 pages = <<42-6-14+2=24>>24 pages

Question: Ivan has a piggy bank that can hold 100 pennies and 50 dimes. How much, in dollars, does Ivan have if he has filled his two piggy banks with those coins?
Answer: Ivan has 50 x 10 = <<50*10=500>>500 cents from the 50 dimes in his one piggy bank.
So, he has a total of 100 + 500 = <<100+500=600>>600 cents in one of his piggy banks.
Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, then Ivan has 600/100 = 6 dollars from one of his piggy banks.
Therefore, Ivan has a total of $6 x 2 piggy banks = $<<6*2=12>>12 from his two piggy banks.
