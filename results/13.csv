Math,0,"Question: A jellyfish tank has numerous jellyfish in it. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. How many jellyfish are in the tank?","Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as 'T'.

From the information given, we know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, which means there are (1/5)T large jellyfish in the tank. 
Out of the large jellyfish, a third change color from green to blue under UV light, so (1/3)((1/5)T) = (1/15)T large jellyfish change color when the UV light is turned on.

The rest of the jellyfish are small and always stay blue, so the number of small jellyfish in the tank is T - (1/5)T = (4/5)T. 
Since all the small jellyfish stay blue, none of them change color under UV light.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish that change color under UV light is (1/15)T (large jellyfish) + 6 (total number of jellyfish that change color) = 6.

Solving the equation, we get (1/15)T + 6 = 6
(1/15)T = 0
T = 0

Therefore, there are no jellyfish in the tank.","A third of the large jellyfish change color, so there are 6 * 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 large jellyfish.
A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so there are 18 * 5 = <<18*5=90>>90 jellyfish in the tank.

Answer: The number of visitors that are residents of NYC is 200 / 2 = <<200/2=100>>100 visitors
The number of NYC resident visitors that are college students is 100 * 0.30 = <<100*0.30=30>>30 visitors

Question: Tyson can swim at a speed of 3 miles per hour in a lake and 2.5 mph in an ocean. This season, half his races happened in lakes and half his races happened in the ocean. He had ten total races, each of which was 3 miles long. How much time did he spend in his races?
Answer: He did 5 races in the lake because 10 / 2 = <<10/2=5>>5
He did 5 races in the ocean because 10 / 2 = <<10/2=5>>5
He raced 15 miles in the lake because 5 x 3 = <<5*3=15>>15
His lake races took 6 hours because 15 / 2.5 = <<15/2.5=6>>6
He raced 15 miles in the ocean because 5 x 3 = <<5*3=15>>15
His ocean races took 5 hours because 15 / 3 = <<15/3=5>>5
He spent 11 hours racing because 5 + 6 = <<5+6=11>>11

Question: A jellyfish tank has numerous jellyfish in it. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. How many jellyfish are in the tank?","Answer: Let's assume there are a total of x jellyfish in the tank.
The number of large jellyfish is x/5.
Out of the large jellyfish, x/5 * 1/3 = x/15 jellyfish change color.
So, the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.
Out of the small jellyfish, 6 jellyfish change color.
Since only large jellyfish change color, 6 = x/15.
Solving for x, we get x = 90.
Therefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.","A third of the large jellyfish change color, so there are 6 * 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 large jellyfish.
A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so there are 18 * 5 = <<18*5=90>>90 jellyfish in the tank.

Math,1b,"Question: Beth is a scuba diver.  She is excavating a sunken ship off the coast of a small Caribbean island and she must remain underwater for long periods.  Her primary tank, which she wears when she first enters the water, has enough oxygen to allow her to stay underwater for 2 hours.  She also has several 1-hour supplemental tanks that she takes with her as well as stores on the ocean floor so she can change tanks underwater without having to come up to the surface.  She will need to be underwater for 8 hours.  How many supplemental tanks will she need?
Answer: For an 8-hour dive, she will use her 2-hour primary tanks and will need supplemental tanks for 8-2=<<8-2=6>>6 additional hours.
Since each supplemental tank holds 1 hour of oxygen, for 6 hours she will need 6/1=<<6/1=6>>6 supplemental tanks.

Question: Bonny just bought her 13th pair of shoes, which is 5 less than twice as many pairs of shoes as Becky owns.  Bobby has 3 times as many pairs of shoes as Becky has.  How many shoes does Bobby have?
Answer: Let x be the number of pairs of shoes that Becky owns.
Since 13 pairs is 5 less than twice as many pairs as Becky owns, then the relationship is 2x-5=13.
Adding 5 to each side of the equation, we get 2x=18.
Solving for x, we get x=<<9=9>>9.
Since Bobby has 3 times as many pairs of shoes as Becky has, then Becky has 3*9=<<3*9=27>>27 pairs of shoes.

Question: A jellyfish tank has numerous jellyfish in it. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. How many jellyfish are in the tank?","Let x be the total number of jellyfish in the tank.

The number of large jellyfish is (1/5)x, and the number of small jellyfish is (4/5)x.

The number of large jellyfish that changed color is (1/3)*(1/5)x = x/15.

The number of small jellyfish that changed color is 6 - x/15.

Since the total number of jellyfish that changed color is 6:
x/15 + 6 - x/15 = 6
6 = 6

Question: A jellyfish tank has numerous jellyfish in it. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. How many jellyfish are in the tank?","Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as J.

Given that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is J/5.
And since a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue, the number of large jellyfish changing color is (1/3)*(J/5) = J/15.

The number of small jellyfish in the tank is 4J/5 (since a fifth are large).

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish changing color when the UV light is turned on is J/15 + 6.
This is equal to the total number of large jellyfish changing color plus the small jellyfish changing color, so:
J/15 + 6 = J/15 + 4J/5.

Solving for J:
J/15 + 6 = J/15 + 4J/5
Multiplying the whole equation by 15 to remove the fractions:
J + 90 = J + 12J
Combining like terms:
90 = 13J
J = 90/13
J = 6.92

Since you can't have a fraction of a jellyfish, the number of jellyfish in the tank must be 7.","A third of the large jellyfish change color, so there are 6 * 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 large jellyfish.
