Math,0,"Question: Chase and Rider can ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days; but on two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days. How many times do they ride their bikes a week?","On usual days, Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days, which makes a total of 3 * 5 = 15 times.
On two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, so they ride 2 * 3 = 6 times each day on these days.
So, on these two days, they ride a total of 6 * 2 = 12 times.
Therefore, in total, they ride their bikes 15 + 12 = 27 times a week.","Each person rides his bike 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 times for 5 days.
Together, they ride 15+15 = <<15+15=30>>30 times for five days.
Each person rides his bike 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 times for every day of the other two days.
This means each person rides 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 times on each day of the other two days.
The total for the other two days is 12+12 = <<12+12=24>>24
For the whole week the together ride 24+30 = <<24+30=54>>54 times

Math,1b,"Question: A Statistics student wants to find out the average daily allowance of the middle school students. According to his survey, 2/3 of the students receive an average of $6 allowance per day while the rest gets an average of $4 a day. If he surveyed 60 students, what is the total amount of money those 60 students get in a day?
Answer: There are 60 students x 2/3 = <<60*2/3=40>>40 students who have a $6 daily allowance.
While there are 60 students - 40 students = <<60-40=20>>20 students who have a $4 daily allowance.
The sum of the allowances of the 40 students who received $6 daily is 40 students x $6/day = $<<40*6=240>>240.
The sum of the allowances of the 20 students who received $4 daily is 20 students x $4/day = $<<20*4=80>>80.
