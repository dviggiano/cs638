Math,1a,"Question: A truck driver has to spend $2 per gallon of gas. She can drive 10 miles per gallon. She drives at a rate of 30 miles per hour. If she is paid $.50 per mile, how much money does she make if she drives for 10 hours?
Answer: The truck driver drives for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so she drives 10*30=<<10*30=300>>300 miles.
Therefore, she needs 300/10=<<300/10=30>>30 gallons of gas.
This will cost her 30*$2=$<<30*2=60>>60.
She will make 300*$.50= $<<300*.50=150>>150.
Thus, after paying for gas, she will make $150-$60=$<<150-60=90>>90.

Question: Karen has 32 quarters in her piggy bank.  Her older brother Christopher has 64 quarters in his piggy bank.  How much more money does Christopher have?
Answer: Christopher has 64 quarters so he has 64*.25 = $<<64*.25=16.00>>16.00
Karen has 32 quarters so she has 32*.25 = $<<32*.25=8.00>>8.00
If Christopher has $16.00 and Karen has $8.00 then Christopher has 16-8 = $<<16-8=8.00>>8.00 more than Karen

Question: The rainstorm flooded the wetlands and washed Phineas Frog 200 yards away from his home in the swamp.  To return home, he will need to hop and swim his way back.  If he hops on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute, and swims through water at a speed of 10 yards per minute, how long will it take Phineas, in minutes, to return home if half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water?","Answer: Since Phineas needs to travel 200 yards back home, he will need to travel 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

For the distance on land: 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

For the distance in water: 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Therefore, it will take Phineas 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes to return home.","Half of 200 yards is 200/2=<<200/2=100>>100 yards.
100 yards at 20 yards per minute is 100/20=<<100/20=5>>5 minutes.
100 yards at 10 yards per minute is 100/10=<<100/10=10>>10 minutes.
In total, it will take Phineas 5+10=<<5+10=15>>15 minutes to return home.

Math,1a,"Question: Max can trade 3 coconuts for a crab and 6 crabs for a goat. If he has 342 coconuts and he wants to convert all of them into goats, how many goats will he have?
Answer: First find the number of crabs Max can get by dividing the number of coconuts by the exchange rate with crabs: 342 coconuts / 3 coconuts/crab = <<342/3=114>>114 crabs
Then divide the number of crabs by the exchange rate with goats: 114 crabs / 6 crabs/goat = <<114/6=19>>19 goats

Question: Caitlin makes bracelets to sell at the farmer’s market every weekend. Each bracelet takes twice as many small beads as it does large beads. If each bracelet uses 12 large beads, and Caitlin has 528 beads with equal amounts of large and small beads, how many bracelets can she make for this weekend?
Answer: Caitlin has 528/2 = <<528/2=264>>264 small beads.
Each bracelet needs 12 * 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 small beads.
Thus, Caitlin can make 264/24 = <<264/24=11>>11 bracelets for the farmer’s market this weekend.

If he hops on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute, and swims through water at a speed of 10 yards per minute, how long will it take Phineas, in minutes, to return home if half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water?","Answer: Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, Phineas will need to travel 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.
To calculate the time it takes to hop on land, divide the distance Phineas needs to travel on land by his speed on land: 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes.
To calculate the time it takes to swim in water, divide the distance Phineas needs to travel in water by his speed in water: 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes.
Adding the time it takes to hop and swim, Phineas will take 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes to return home. 
#### 15","Half of 200 yards is 200/2=<<200/2=100>>100 yards.

Answer: The truck driver drives for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so she drives 10*30=<<10*30=300>>300 miles.
Therefore, she needs 300/10=<<300/10=30>>30 gallons of gas.
