Math,1a,"Question: If Lyn donates $240 to a private organization each year where 1/3 of it goes to the community pantry project, 1/2 goes to the local crisis fund, 1/4 of the remaining goes to livelihood project funds, and the rest is for contingency funds. How much goes to contingency fund?
Answer: The community pantry project gets 240 x 1/3 = $<<240*1/3=80>>80.
The local crisis fund has 240 x 1/2 = $<<240*1/2=120>>120.
The total funds allocated for the two funds is $80 + $120 = $<<80+120=200>>200.
So, $240 - $200 = $<<240-200=40>>40 are left for the other 2 funds.
The livelihood project gets $40 x 1/4 = $<<40*1/4=10>>10.
This means that the contingency fund is $40 - $10 = $<<40-10=30>>30.

Q: Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less, each, because she had to complete some assignments. If the rest of the week she slept 1 hour more than those two days, how many hours did she sleep in total throughout the week?","A: Sadie slept 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 hours on Tuesday and Wednesday.
On Thursday and Friday, she slept 6 + 1 = <<6+1=7>>7 hours each day.
Therefore, throughout the week, Sadie slept a total of 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 = <<8+6+6+7+7=34>>34 hours.","If on Monday she slept 8 hours, then she slept 8-2 = <<8-2=6>>6 hours on each of the next two days.
The total number of hours slept for the two days will be 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 hours.
If she slept 1 hour more for the rest of the week each day, then each day she slept 6+1 = <<6+1=7>>7 hours.
The total for the rest of the week will be 4*7 = <<4*7=28>>28 hours.
The total number of hours slept for the whole week will be 8+12+28 = <<8+12+28=48>>48 hours.

Question: Jack is ordering custom baseball caps for him and his two best friends. Jack's head is 12 inches in circumference. Charlie's head is 9 inches more than half the circumference of Jack's head. Bill's head is 2/3 the circumference of Charlie's head. How many inches in circumference is Bill's head?
Answer: First find half the circumference of Jack's head: 12 inches / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 inches
Then find how big Charlie's head is: 6 inches + 9 inches = <<6+9=15>>15 inches
Then find how big Bill's head is: 15 inches * 2/3 = <<15*2/3=10>>10 inches

Q: Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less, each, because she had to complete some assignments. If the rest of the week she slept 1 hour more than those two days, how many hours did she sleep in total throughout the week?","A: On Tuesday and Wednesday, Sadie slept 8 hours - 2 hours = 6 hours each day.
So for those two days, she slept a total of 6 hours/day * 2 days = 12 hours.
For the rest of the week, she slept 6 hours + 1 hour = 7 hours per day.
Therefore, for the rest of the week, she slept a total of 7 hours/day * 5 days = 35 hours.
Adding up all the hours, Sadie slept a total of 8 hours + 12 hours + 35 hours = 55 hours throughout the week.","If on Monday she slept 8 hours, then she slept 8-2 = <<8-2=6>>6 hours on each of the next two days.
The total number of hours slept for the two days will be 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 hours.
If she slept 1 hour more for the rest of the week each day, then each day she slept 6+1 = <<6+1=7>>7 hours.
The total for the rest of the week will be 4*7 = <<4*7=28>>28 hours.
The total number of hours slept for the whole week will be 8+12+28 = <<8+12+28=48>>48 hours.
