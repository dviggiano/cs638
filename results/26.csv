Q: A three-toed sloth moves very slowly, and only eats when he is up in his tree.  For a meal of berries, it takes the sloth 4 hours to make the trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up into his tree.  Assuming he picks the same number of berries on each trip, what is the least number of berries he can pick up per trip down to the ground if he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours?","A: The sloth has 8 hours to collect berries, which means he can make 2 trips (8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips). If he wants to collect 24 berries in total and picks the same number each trip, he needs to pick up 24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip. Therefore, the sloth needs to pick at least 12 berries per trip down to the ground.","If one trip is 4-hours long, in 8 hours he can make 8/4=<<8/4=2>>2 trips.
To collect 24 berries per 2 trips, he needs to collect 24 / 2 = <<24/2=12>>12 berries per trip.
