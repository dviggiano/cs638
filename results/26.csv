Math,0,"Question: Marcell and Beatrice are having a contest to see who can eat the most fruit roll-ups, so they unroll as many as they can find. Unfortunately, someone makes a mistake and Beatrice's was two roll-ups wide and 24 rolls up long while Marcell's was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long. If they both ate their entire amount, how many did they eat on average?","To find out how many fruit roll-ups each of them ate on average, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each of them had.

For Beatrice:
Total number of fruit roll-ups = 2 (width) * 24 (length) = 48 roll-ups

For Marcell:
Total number of fruit roll-ups = 3 (width) * 14 (length) = 42 roll-ups

Now, we can find the average number of fruit roll-ups each of them ate by dividing the total number of fruit roll-ups by 2 (since there are 2 people in the contest):

Average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Beatrice = 48 / 2 = 24 roll-ups
Average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell = 42 / 2 = 21 roll-ups

Therefore, on average, Beatrice ate 24 fruit roll-ups and Marcell ate 21 fruit roll-ups.","Beatrice ate 48 because 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48.
Marcell ate 42 because 14 x 3 = <<14*3=42>>42
In total they ate 90 because 48 + 42 = <<48+42=90>>90
On average they ate 45 because 90 / 2 = <<90/2=45>>45

Math,1a,"Question: It takes Bryan 5 minutes to walk from his house to the bus station. Then he rides the bus for 20 minutes. After that, he walks 5 minutes from the bus station to his job. It takes the same amount of time in the morning and the evening. How many hours per year does Bryan spend traveling to and from work, if he works every day?
Answer: Bryan spends 5+20+5 =<<5+20+5=30>>30 minutes traveling to work.
He does this twice a day, so he spends 30*2=<<30*2=60>>60 minutes traveling per day.
Thus, he spends 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour traveling to and from work every day.
Thus, he spends 1 hour*365 days =<<1*365=365>>365 hours traveling per year.

Marcell had 42 fruit roll-ups because 3 x 14 = <<3*14=42>>42
They ate 90 fruit roll-ups total because 48 + 42 = <<48+42=90>>90

Beatrice had 2 roll-ups wide * 24 roll-ups long = 48 fruit roll-ups.
Marcell had 3 roll-ups wide * 14 roll-ups long = 42 fruit roll-ups.

Therefore, Beatrice ate 48 fruit roll-ups and Marcell ate 42 fruit roll-ups.

To find the average amount each person ate, we need to divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by the number of people.

Beatrice ate 48 roll-ups / 1 person = 48 roll-ups/person.
Marcell ate 42 roll-ups / 1 person = 42 roll-ups/person.
