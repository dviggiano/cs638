Math,1a,"Question: Mason is trying to download a 880 MB game to his phone. After downloading 310 MB, his Internet connection slows to 3 MB/minute. How many more minutes will it take him to download the game?
Answer: First find how many MB are left to download: 880 MB - 310 MB = <<880-310=570>>570 MB
Then divide that number by the download speed to find the download time: 570 MB / 3 MB/minute = <<570/3=190>>190 minutes

Question: Janet is getting paid to moderate social media posts. She gets paid 25 cents per post she checks. If it takes her 10 seconds to check a post, how much does she earn per hour?
Answer: First find the number of seconds in an hour: 1 hour * 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute = <<1*60*60=3600>>3600 seconds/hour.
Then divide the total number of seconds per hour by the number of seconds it takes Janet to read one post: 3600 seconds/hour / 10 seconds/post = <<3600/10=360>>360 posts/hour.
Then multiply the number of posts she checks per hour by her pay per post to find her hourly pay: $0.25/post * 360 posts/hour = $<<0.25*360=90>>90/hour.

Question: Fishio posted her selfie on Instagram. She received 2000 likes on the photo after 1 week. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. If she received 20000 more new likes recently, how many Instagram likes are there?","Answer: First, find the total number of likes after three weeks by multiplying the initial number of likes by 70: 2000 likes * 70 = 140,000 likes.
Then add the 20000 new likes to find the total number of likes: 140,000 likes + 20,000 likes = <<140000+20000=160000>>160,000 likes.
So, there are 160,000 Instagram likes in total.","After receiving 2000 likes on her photo on Instagram on the first week, Fishio received 70*2000 = <<70*2000=140000>>140000 new likes on the photo after three more weeks.
The total number of likes in the four weeks is 140000+2000 = <<140000+2000=142000>>142000
If Fishio received 20000 more likes recently, the number of likes on the photo is 142000+20000=<<142000+20000=162000>>162000

First, we need to find out how many likes Fishio's photo had after three weeks. Since it was 70 times the initial number of likes, we have:

2000 likes * 70 = 140,000 likes after three weeks.

Adding the new likes she recently received, we have:

140,000 likes + 20,000 new likes = 160,000 total likes.

Question: Fishio posted her selfie on Instagram. She received 2000 likes on the photo after 1 week. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. If she received 20000 more new likes recently, how many Instagram likes are there?","Let the initial number of likes be x.

After 3 weeks, the number of likes is 70 times the initial number of likes, so 70x.

Including the initial 2000 likes, the total number of likes after 3 weeks is 70x + 2000.

Adding the recent 20000 new likes, the total number of likes is 70x + 2000 + 20000.

Given that this total number of likes is equal to the recent total number of likes, we have:

70x + 2000 + 20000 = 70x + 2000 + 20000

Solving for x, we get:

70x = 70x

Therefore, the total number of Instagram likes is 70x + 2000 + 20000, which simplifies to 70x + 22000. Since x can be any number representing the initial number of likes, the total number of Instagram likes varies based on the initial likes.","After receiving 2000 likes on her photo on Instagram on the first week, Fishio received 70*2000 = <<70*2000=140000>>140000 new likes on the photo after three more weeks.
