Math,0,"Question: On a certain day, the total cost of filling up 20 helium balloons was $900. Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. How much did Bentley pay to fill 170 balloons if he went to fill them after the price increase?","First, we need to find the original cost of filling each balloon. 

Total cost of filling 20 balloons = $900
Cost of filling each balloon initially = $900 / 20 = $45

After the price increase of $20, the new cost of filling each balloon = $45 + $20 = $65

Therefore, the total cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase = $65 * 170 = $11050

Bentley paid $11,050 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase.","If the total cost of filling up 20 helium balloons was $900 before the price increase, the cost of filling one balloon was $900/20=$<<900/20=45>>45
Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20 to $45+$20=$<<45+20=65>>65
If Bentley had 170 balloons that he wanted to fill, after the price increase, Bentley paid 170*$65=$<<170*65=11050>>11050 to fill 170 balloons.

Math,1a,"Question: Martin is casting three bells for the church's belfry. The first bell takes 50 pounds of bronze, the second bell is twice the size of the first bell, and the third bell is four times the size of the second bell. How much bronze does he need total?
Answer: First find the size of the second bell: 50 pounds * 2 = <<50*2=100>>100 pounds
Then find the size of the third bell: 100 pounds * 4 = <<100*4=400>>400 pounds
Then add the amount of bronze used for each bell to find the total: 100 pounds + 400 pounds + 50 pounds = <<100+400+50=550>>550 pounds

Question: A bag of dozen apples costs $14 and Brian has already spent $10 on kiwis and half that much on bananas. What's the maximum number of apples Brian can buy if he left his house with only $50 and needs to pay the $3.50 subway fare each way?
Answer: Brian requires a total of $3.50 + $3.50 = $<<3.5+3.5=7>>7 to pay for the round trip subway fare
We also know he has spent half (1/2) the amount he spent on kiwis on bananas, so he'll spend (1/2) * $10 = $5 on bananas
So far in total he has spent $7 for his subway fare + $5 on bananas + $10 on kiwis = $7 + $5 + $10 = $<<7+5+10=22>>22
If he left his house with only $50, then all he will have left for apples would be $50 - $22 = $<<50-22=28>>28
If a bag of apples costs $14, then Brian would only be able to buy a maximum of $28/$14 = 2 bags of apples
If each bag of apples has a dozen (12) apples, then (2) two bags will have 12*2= <<2*12=24>>24 apples

Question: On a certain day, the total cost of filling up 20 helium balloons was $900. Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. How much did Bentley pay to fill 170 balloons if he went to fill them after the price increase?","Let's first find the cost of filling one balloon on the certain day. We divide the total cost by the number of balloons: $900 / 20 balloons = $45 per balloon.

After the price increase, the cost to fill each balloon is $45 + $20 = $65 per balloon.

So to fill 170 balloons after the price increase, Bentley paid 170 balloons * $65 per balloon = $11,050. 

Therefore, Bentley paid $11,050 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase.","If the total cost of filling up 20 helium balloons was $900 before the price increase, the cost of filling one balloon was $900/20=$<<900/20=45>>45
Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20 to $45+$20=$<<45+20=65>>65
If Bentley had 170 balloons that he wanted to fill, after the price increase, Bentley paid 170*$65=$<<170*65=11050>>11050 to fill 170 balloons.

Math,1b,"Question: A store is selling mobile phones. This store contains 20 units of phones but the owner found out that there were 5 defective units. After he got rid of the defective units, he started to sell the rest of his units to customer A who bought 3 units, customer B who bought a certain amount of units, and customer C who bought 7 units. In the end, all non-defective units were sold. How many units were sold to Customer B?
Answer: There were 20 - 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 units of non-defective smartphones.
There were 3 + 7 = <<3+7=10>>10 units sold to customers A and C.
So, 15 - 10 = <<15-10=5>>5 units were sold to customer B.

Question: A school principal is booking hotel rooms for a class of 30 students to stay at during an overnight field trip.  Each of the hotel's rooms has two queen size beds, which can fit two students each, and a pull-out couch, which can fit one student.  How many rooms does the principal need to book to fit all of the students in the class?

How much did Bentley pay to fill 170 balloons if he went to fill them after the price increase?","Answer: The cost of filling up 20 balloons on the day Bentley went was $900, so each balloon cost $900/20 = $45.
After the price increase, each balloon cost $45 + $20 = $65.
Therefore, Bentley paid $65 x 170 = $11,050 to fill up 170 balloons.","If the total cost of filling up 20 helium balloons was $900 before the price increase, the cost of filling one balloon was $900/20=$<<900/20=45>>45
