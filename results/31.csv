Question: John builds a box.  The box is 26 inches by 26 inches by 14 inches.  The walls are 1 inch thick on each side.  How much is the internal volume in cubic feet?
Answer: The walls take away 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 inches from each dimension
So the longer sides are 26-2=<<26-2=24>>24 inches
That is 24/12=<<24/12=2>>2 feet
The smaller dimension is 14-2=<<14-2=12>>12 inches
That is 12/12=<<12/12=1>>1 foot
So the internal volume is 2*2*1=<<2*2*1=4>>4 cubic feet

Question: Darren decides to do body exercises for a whole week. He does 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses on the first day. On the second day, he does 20 more pushups than on the first day, ten fewer squats, and doubles the number of dumbbell presses. What's the total count of the activities he's done in the two days?","Answer: On the second day, Darren does 100 + 20 = <<100+20=120>>120 pushups.
He does 50 - 10 = <<50-10=40>>40 squats on the second day.
He doubles the number of dumbbell presses on the second day, so he does 20 * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 dumbbell presses.
In total, Darren has done 100 + 120 = <<100+120=220>>220 pushups.
He has done 50 + 40 = <<50+40=90>>90 squats.
And he has done 20 + 40 = <<20+40=60>>60 dumbbell presses.
Therefore, in the two days, Darren has done 220 + 90 + 60 = <<220+90+60=370>>370 activities.","The total count of activities for the first day is 100+50+20 = <<100+50+20=170>>170
On the second day, he does 100+20 = <<100+20=120>>120 pushups
He also does 50-10 = <<50-10=40>>40 squats on the second day
For the dumbbell presses, he doubles the number of the first day, which becomes 2*20 = <<2*20=40>>40
The total count for the three activities on the second day is 40+40+120 = <<40+40+120=200>>200
For the two days, his total count for all the three activities is 200+170 = <<200+170=370>>370

Math,1a,"Question: If the wages of 15 workers for 6 days is $9450. What would be the wages for 19 workers for 5 days?
Answer: This is equivalent to one worker working for 15 * 6 = <<15*6=90>>90 days.
The pay per worker per day would be $9450 / 90 = $<<9450/90=105>>105.
19 workers working for 5 days is equivalent to one worker working for 19 * 5 = <<19*5=95>>95 days.
It would cost $105 * 95 = $<<105*95=9975>>9975 to pay the workers for their time.

On the second day, he does 20 more pushups than on the first day, ten fewer squats, and doubles the number of dumbbell presses. What's the total count of the activities he's done in the two days?","To find the total count of activities Darren has done in the two days, we first need to calculate the activities he did on the second day.

On the second day, Darren did:
- 100 pushups + 20 = 120 pushups
- 50 squats - 10 = 40 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Adding these up, we get:
120 pushups + 40 squats + 40 dumbbell presses = 200 activities on the second day

Adding the activities from both days:
100 pushups + 50 squats + 20 dumbbell presses (Day 1) + 120 pushups + 40 squats + 40 dumbbell presses (Day 2) = 470 activities in total over the two days.","The total count of activities for the first day is 100+50+20 = <<100+50+20=170>>170

He also does 50-10 = <<50-10=40>>40 squats on the second day
For the dumbbell presses, he doubles the number of the first day, which becomes 2*20 = <<2*20=40>>40
The total count for the three activities on the second day is 40+40+120 = <<40+40+120=200>>200
