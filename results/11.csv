Question: A $2000 watch was put on sale so that Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price. He then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price that he bought it. What is the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price?","Answer: Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, which is $2000 x 0.75 = $1500.
He sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is $1500 x 1.2 = $1800.
Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price is ((2000 - 1800) / 2000) x 100% = (200 / 2000) x 100% = 10%.
Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price is 10%.","Mr. Roger bought the perfume at $2000 x 75/100 = $<<2000*75/100=1500>>1500.
He then sold it to his friend at $1500 x 120/100 = $<<1500*120/100=1800>>1800
So, Mr. Roger's friend paid $2000 - $1800 = $<<2000-1800=200>>200 less than the original price.
So, his friend got $200/$2000 x 100% = <<200/2000*100=10>>10% discount.
