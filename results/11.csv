Math,0,"Question: In a room, there are various toys: 5 red cars, 3 action figures, and a doll. The doll cost as much as 3 action figures and one red car cost $4. How much are all toys worth, of an action figure costs $5?","Let's calculate the total cost of each type of toy:

1 doll = 3 action figures
3 action figures = 3 * $5 = $15
1 doll = $15

1 red car = $4
5 red cars = 5 * $4 = $20

Total cost of toys:
5 red cars + 3 action figures + 1 doll = $20 + $15 + $15 = $50

Therefore, all toys are worth $50.","Three actions figures are worth 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15, as much as the doll.
The red cars are worth 5 * 4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.
So all toys are worth 20 + 15 + 15 = $<<20+15+15=50>>50.

Math,1a,"Question: Emily can type 60 words per minute. How many hours does it take her to write 10,800 words?
Answer: In an hour, Emily can type 60 words *60 minutes = <<60*60=3600>>3600 words.
It will take her 10800/3600 = <<10800/3600=3>>3 hours to write 10800 words.

Question: Tiffany attends the carnival and her mother gives her $3 to play on a ring toss game. For every red bucket she tosses a ring into she gets 2 points. For every green bucket she gets three points. She gets zero points for a miss. Every play costs her $1 and she gets 5 rings per play. She's played two games and already gotten 4 red buckets and 5 green buckets. If she plays until her money runs out, what is the most total points she can get for all three games?
Answer: She has 8 points from red buckets because 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8
She has 15 points from green buckets because 5 x 3 = <<5*3=15>>15
She has spent $2 on games because 2 x 1 = <<2*1=2>>2
She has $1 left to spend because 3 - 2 = <<3-2=1>>1
She can play one more game because 1 / 1 = <<1/1=1>>1
The best bucket gives three points because 3 > 2
The most she can earn in the final game is 15 because 5 x 3 = <<5*3=15>>15
The most she can score overall is 38 because 8 + 15 + 15 = <<8+15+15=38>>38

Question: In a room, there are various toys: 5 red cars, 3 action figures, and a doll. The doll cost as much as 3 action figures and one red car cost $4. How much are all toys worth, of an action figure costs $5?","Answer: 

The doll is equal to 3 action figures, so it is worth 3 x $5 = $15.

An action figure costs $5, so 3 action figures are worth 3 x $5 = $15.

The 5 red cars are worth 5 x $4 = $20.

Adding the value of all the toys, we get $15 (doll) + $15 (action figures) + $20 (red cars) = $50.

Therefore, all the toys are worth $50.","Three actions figures are worth 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15, as much as the doll.
The red cars are worth 5 * 4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.
So all toys are worth 20 + 15 + 15 = $<<20+15+15=50>>50.

Math,1b,"Question: The math teacher would be happy if the class average test score was at least 85. There are 10 students in the class, 5 of which scored a 92 on the test and 4 of which scored an 80. What would the last student have to score to at least make the teacher happy?
Answer: 5 students scored a combined total of 92 * 5 = <<92*5=460>>460
4 additional students scored a combined total of 80 * 4 = <<80*4=320>>320
9 students therefore scored a combined total of 460 + 320 = <<460+320=780>>780
We know the total combined score for 10 students must be at least 85 average * 10 students = <<85*10=850>>850
Therefore, the last student must score at least an 850 - 780 = <<850-780=70>>70

Question: Kyle bakes 60 cookies and 32 brownies. Kyle eats 2 cookies and 2 brownies. Kyle's mom eats 1 cookie and 2 brownies. If Kyle sells a cookie for $1 and a brownie for $1.50, how much money will Kyle make if he sells all of his baked goods?
Answer: Kyle and his mom eat a total of 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 cookies
Kyle and his mom eat a total of 2 + 2 = <<2+2=4>>4 brownies
The number of cookies remaining is 60 - 3 = <<60-3=57>>57 cookies
The number of brownies remaining is 32 - 4 = <<32-4=28>>28 brownies
From selling his cookies, Kyle makes 57 * $1 = $<<57*1=57>>57
From selling his brownies, Kyle makes 28 * $1.50 = $<<28*1.5=42>>42
Kyle would make a total of $57 + $42 = $<<57+42=99>>99 if he sold all of his baked goods

Question: In a room, there are various toys: 5 red cars, 3 action figures, and a doll. The doll cost as much as 3 action figures and one red car cost $4. How much are all toys worth, of an action figure costs $5?","Answer: 
The doll costs 3 * $5 = $15
One red car costs $4, so 5 red cars cost 5 * $4 = $20
In total, the toys are worth $15 (doll) + $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) = $<<15+20+15=50>>50.
Therefore, all the toys are worth $50.","Three actions figures are worth 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15, as much as the doll.
The red cars are worth 5 * 4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.
