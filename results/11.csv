Math,0,"Question: A bag of flour is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each. How much flour (in kilograms) was in three bags in total, before it was divided into portions?","The total amount of flour in three bags before they were divided into portions is:

3 bags x 8 portions x 2 kilograms = 48 kilograms

Therefore, there was a total of 48 kilograms of flour in three bags before they were divided into portions.","A bag of flour has 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 kilograms.
So, there are 16 x 3 = <<16*3=48>>48 kilograms of flour in 3 bags.

Question: Apollo pulls the sun across the sky every night. Once a month, his fiery chariot’s wheels need to be replaced. He trades golden apples to Hephaestus the blacksmith to get Hephaestus to make him new wheels. Hephaestus raised his rates halfway through the year and now demands twice as many golden apples as before. He charged three golden apples for the first six months. How many golden apples does Apollo have to pay for the entire year of chariot wheels?
Answer: Apollo had to pay 3 * 6 = <<3*6=18>>18 golden apples for the first six months.
For the second six months, he had to pay twice that amount, or 18 * 2 = <<18*2=36>>36 golden apples.
Thus, Apollo had to pay 18 + 36 = <<18+36=54>>54 golden apples for a year of chariot wheels.
