Math,1a,"Question: Sandra had 2 different bags of candy.  Each of her bags had 6 pieces of candy left.  Her brother, Roger, also had 2 bags of candy.  One of his bags of candy had 11 pieces left and the other had 3 pieces left.  How much more candy did Roger have?
Answer: Sandra had 2 bags that each contained 6 pieces of candy so 2*6 = <<2*6=12>>12 pieces
Roger had 11 pieces of candy in one bag and 3 pieces in the other so 11+3 = <<11+3=14>>14 pieces
Roger had 14 pieces and Sandra had 12 pieces so Roger has 14-12 = <<14-12=2>>2 more pieces of candy

Question: It takes a butterfly egg 120 days to become a butterfly. If each butterfly spends 3 times as much time as a larva as in a cocoon, how long does each butterfly spend in a cocoon?
Answer: Let c be the amount of time the butterfly spends in a cocoon and l be the amount of time it spends as a larva. We know that l = 3c and l + c = 120.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 3c + c = 120.
Combining like terms, we get 4c = 120.
Dividing both sides by 4, we get c = 30.

Q: There are 40 pupils in a class. Half of the class likes blue. One-fourth of the remaining likes green and the rest likes yellow. How many pupils like the color yellow?","A: Half of the class is 40 / 2 = 20 pupils who like blue.
The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20 pupils.
One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so 20 / 4 = 5 pupils like green.
Thus, the remaining pupils who like yellow are 20 - 5 = 15 pupils. 
Therefore, 15 pupils like the color yellow.","There are 40/2 = <<40/2=20>>20 pupils who like blue.
So, there are now 40 - 20 = <<40-20=20>>20 pupils who like either green or yellow.
Hence, 20/4 = <<20/4=5>>5 pupils like green.
Thus, 20 - 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 pupils like yellow.

Math,1a,"Question: Mr. and Mrs. Hugo went on a road trip. On the first day, they traveled 200 miles. On the second day, they traveled 3/4 as far. On the third day, they traveled 1/2 as many miles as the first two days combined. How many miles did they travel for 3 days?
Answer: On the second day, Mr. and Mrs. Hugo traveled 200 x 3/4 = <<200*3/4=150>>150 miles.
They traveled a total of 200 + 150 = <<200+150=350>>350 miles in the first two days.
On the third day, they traveled 350 x 1/2 = <<350*1/2=175>>175 miles.
So, Mr. and Mrs. Hugo traveled a total of 200 + 150 + 175 = <<200+150+175=525>>525 miles for 3 days.
