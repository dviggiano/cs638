Math,1a,"Question: An employee makes 30 dollars an hour for the first 40 hours in the workweek and an additional 50% for every hour above 40 in the week.  If he works 6 hours for the first 3 days in the workweek and twice as many hours per day for the remaining 2 days, how much money did he make?
Answer: His overtime pay per hour is 30*1.5=$<<30*1.5=45>>45 per hour
He works 6*2=<<6*2=12>>12 hours per day for the last two days.
He works 6+6+6+12+12=<<6+6+6+12+12=42>>42 hours
He gets 42-40=<<42-40=2>>2 hours of overtime.
He makes 40*30+2*45=$<<40*30+2*45=1290>>1290 for the week

Question: Nick is trying to raise money for a charity. He is selling candy bars for $5. He is also selling chocolate oranges for $10. He wants to raise $1000. He only had 20 chocolate oranges that he sold out. How many candy bars does Nick need to sell to reach his goal?
Answer: Nick has made 20 * $10 = $<<20*10=200>>200 from the chocolate oranges.
This means he needs to raise another $1000 - $200 = $<<1000-200=800>>800.
He needs to sell a total of $800 / $5 = <<800/5=160>>160 candy bars to reach his goal.

Question: Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar to make a batch of suckers and 70 ounces of sugar to make a batch of fudge. How much sugar does he need to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge?","Answer: Mason needs 30 * 8 = <<30*8=240>>240 ounces of sugar for the suckers.
He needs 70 * 1 = <<70*1=70>>70 ounces of sugar for the fudge.
Therefore, he needs a total of 240 + 70 = <<240+70=310>>310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.","First find the total sugar needed for the suckers: 30 ounces/batch * 8 batches = <<30*8=240>>240 ounces
Then add the amount he needs to make the fudge to find the total amount of sugar needed: 240 ounces + 70 ounces = <<240+70=310>>310 ounces

Math,1a,"Question: Paul lives in a 5th story apartment.  He makes 3 trips out from and back to his apartment throughout the day each day of a week.  How many feet does he travel vertically in total over the week if each story is 10 feet tall?
Answer: Since Paul makes 3 trips per day, and each trip involves going both down and up, this means he travels the full vertical distance of his apartment complex 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 times a day.
Since there are 7 days in a week, this means he makes this trip 6*7=42 times a week.
Since each story is 10 feet tall, that means with 5 stories he travels 5*10= <<5*10=50>>50 feet each trip.
Since he made 42 trips of 50 feet each, this means he traveled 50*42= <<50*42=2100>>2100 feet in a week.

Question: The profit from a business transaction is shared among 2 business partners, Mike and Johnson in the ratio 2:5 respectively. If Johnson got $2500, how much will Mike have after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200?
Answer: According to the ratio, for every 5 parts that Johnson gets, Mike gets 2 parts
Since Johnson got $2500, each part is therefore $2500/5 = $<<2500/5=500>>500
Mike will get 2*$500 = $<<2*500=1000>>1000
After buying the shirt he will have $1000-$200 = $<<1000-200=800>>800 left

To make 1 batch of fudge, Mason would need 70 ounces of sugar.
Therefore, to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge, Mason would need 240+70 = <<240+70=310>>310 ounces of sugar in total. 
So, Mason would need 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.","First find the total sugar needed for the suckers: 30 ounces/batch * 8 batches = <<30*8=240>>240 ounces
