Math,0,"Question: Jenna has 4 roommates. Each month the electricity bill is $100. How much will each roommate pay per year for electricity, if they divide the share equally?","If Jenna has 4 roommates and the electricity bill is $100 per month, the total electricity bill for the 5 of them is $500 per month.

In a year, they will pay a total of $500 x 12 months = $6000 for electricity.

If they divide the share equally, each roommate will pay $6000 / 5 people = $120 per year for electricity.","There are 12 months in a year, so the total electricity for the year will cost 100*12 =$<<100*12=1200>>1200.
Since there are 5 roommates, each roommate will pay 1200/5=$<<1200/5=240>>240 in a year.
