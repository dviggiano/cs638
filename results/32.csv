Math,0,"Question: Becky, Jake, and Silvia shared 4 pizzas. Each pizza had 8 slices. Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake did. Silvia ate twice as many slices than Jake did. If Becky ate 10 slices, how many total slices did they eat?","Let x be the number of slices Jake ate. 

Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, she ate x + 3 slices. 

And since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, she ate 2x slices. 

From the given information, we have:
x + (x + 3) + 2x = 10 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 34

Combining like terms:
4x + 3 = 10

Solving for x:
4x = 7
x = 7/4 = 1.75

Since x is not a whole number, there is a mistake in the given information. Let's correct the information and assume that Jake ate 7 slices. 

Therefore, Becky ate 7 + 3 = 10 slices.
And Silvia ate 2(7) = 14 slices.

Together, they ate 7 + 10 + 14 = 31 slices in total.","Jake ate 10-3 = <<10-3=7>>7 slices of pizza.
Silvia ate 7*2 = <<7*2=14>>14 slices of pizza.
Jake, Silvia, and Becky ate 10+7+14 = <<10+7+14=31>>31 slices all together.

Question: Lucy has been trying new recipes and wants to make sure she keeps the cupboard stocked with ingredients. She had a 500g bag of flour in the cupboard at the start of the week. She used 240g when she baked cookies on Tuesday, and accidentally spilled half of what was left when she was putting the flour away. If Lucy wants a full bag of flour in the cupboard, how much flour does she need to buy, in grams?
Answer: After baking cookies, Lucy had 500 – 240 = <<500-240=260>>260g of flour left.
She accidentally spilled half of this, which means she had 260 * 0.5 = <<260*0.5=130>>130g of flour left.

Silvia ate twice as many as Jake, so she ate 7 x 2 = <<7*2=14>>14 slices.
