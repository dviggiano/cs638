Math,1a,"Question: A rectangular flowerbed in the city park is 4 meters wide. Its length is 1 meter less than twice its width. The government wants to fence the flowerbed. How many meters of fence are needed?
Answer: Twice the width is 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 meters.
The length of the rectangular flowerbed is 8 - 1= <<8-1=7>>7 meters.
Since the rectangular flower bed has 2 equal lengths, then it needs 7 x 2 = <<7*2=14>>14 meters of fence.
The rectangular bed has also 2 equal widths, so it needs 4 x 2 = <<8=8>>8 meters of fence.
Therefore, the rectangular flower bed needs a total of 14 + 8 = <<14+8=22>>22 meters of fence.

Question: A parking garage of a mall is four stories tall. On the first level, there are 90 parking spaces. The second level has 8 more parking spaces than on the first level, and there are 12 more available parking spaces on the third level than on the second level. The fourth level has 9 fewer parking spaces than the third level. If 100 cars are already parked, how many cars can be accommodated by the parking garage?
Answer: The second level has 90 + 8 = <<90+8=98>>98 parking spaces.
The third level has 98 + 12 = <<98+12=110>>110 parking spaces.
The fourth level has 110 - 9 = <<110-9=101>>101 parking spaces.
So the parking garage can accommodate 90 + 98 + 110 + 101 = <<90+98+110+101=399>>399 cars.
Thus, the parking garage can still accommodate 399 - 100 = <<399-100=299>>299 cars.

Q: Derrick has a bakery that makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day, selling at $2 per doughnut. How much money does Derrick make in June if he sells all the doughnuts?","A: Since there are 12 doughnuts in a dozen, Derrick makes 10 x 12 = <<10*12=120>>120 doughnuts per day.
If he sells each doughnut at $2, he makes $2 x 120 = $<<2*120=240>>240 per day.
Therefore, in June, with 30 days, Derrick makes $240 x 30 = $<<240*30=7200>>7200.
Therefore, Derrick makes $7200 in June if he sells all the doughnuts.","A dozen doughnuts have 12 doughnuts, and if Derrick makes 10 dozen in a day, the total number of doughnuts he makes is 10*12 = <<10*12=120>>120 doughnuts.
Since each doughnut sells at $2 per piece, Derrick makes 120*$2 = $<<120*2=240>>240 per day from selling his doughnuts.
In June, with 30 days, after making and selling the doughnuts every day, Derrick makes $240*30 = $<<30*240=7200>>7200

Math,1a,"Question: A store has an 8% discount on all items. If Shara paid $184 for a pair of shoes, how much did Shara save?
Answer: The price that Shara paid is only 100% - 8% = 92% of the original price.
So, every 1% is equal to $184/92 = $2.
Therefore, Shara saved $2 x 8 = $<<2*8=16>>16.

Question: James won a money prize at a charity raffle. He donated half of his winnings back to the charity, then spent $2 on a hot dog to celebrate his win. He had $55 left over. How many dollars did he win?
Answer: Let W be equal to James’s raffle winnings.
He donated half his winnings, so he had W - W/2 = W/2 left.
He then spent $2 on a hot dog, so W/2 - 2 = $55.
Thus, half his winnings is W/2 = 55 + 2 = <<55+2=57>>57.
James won W = 57 * 2 = $<<57*2=114>>114.

If he sells each doughnut at $2, then he makes $2 x 120 = $240 per day.
Since June has 30 days, Derrick makes $240 x 30 = $<<240*30=7200>>7200 in June.
Therefore, Derrick makes $7200 in June by selling all the doughnuts.","A dozen doughnuts have 12 doughnuts, and if Derrick makes 10 dozen in a day, the total number of doughnuts he makes is 10*12 = <<10*12=120>>120 doughnuts.
