Question: Annie is building a diorama for her history class. The amount of time she spent building it is equal to three times the amount of time she spent planning it minus 5 minutes. If she spent 67 minutes on the diorama total, how many minutes did she spend building it?
Answer: Let p be the planning time in minutes and b be the building time. We know that b = 3p - 5 and b + p = 67
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 3p - 5 + p = 67
Combining like terms, we get 4p - 5 = 67
Adding 5 to both sides, we get 4p = 72
Dividing both sides by 4, we get p = 18
Substituting this value into b = 3p - 5, we find that b = 3 * 18 - 5 = <<3*18-5=49>>49

Question: Bob needs to buy potting soil to fill the raised beds in his vegetable garden. He has 10 raised beds, and each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall. Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil and costs $12. How much will the potting soil cost him?","Answer: Each raised bed can hold 2ft * 8ft * 2ft = <<2*8*2=32>>32 cubic feet of soil.
Therefore, for all 10 raised beds, Bob will need 10 beds * 32 cubic feet/bed = <<10*32=320>>320 cubic feet of soil.
Since each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, Bob will need 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = <<320/2=160>>160 bags of potting soil.
Therefore, the total cost of the potting soil will be 160 bags * $12/bag = $<<160*12=1920>>1920. Answer: $1920.","Each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet high, so they each hold 2 * 8 * 2 = <<2*8*2=32>>32 cubic feet of dirt.
He has 10 beds, so he will need 10 * 32 = <<10*32=320>>320 cubic feet of dirt.
Each bag of soil is 0.75 cubic feet, so Bob will need 320 / 2 = <<320/2=160>>160 bags of soil.
Each bag is $12, so all the soil will cost him $12 * 160 = $<<12*160=1920>>1920.

Question: Elisa and her two friends went out to dinner. Each of them ordered a meal worth $10. Afterwards, they each had a scoop of the same kind of ice cream. If the $45 Elisa had was enough to pay for everything, what was the cost of a scoop of ice cream?
Answer: The three friends had meals worth 10 * 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 dollars
If they paid for the meals only, they would have remained with 45 - 30 = <<45-30=15>>15 dollars.
Dividing the remaining amount by the number of ice cream scoops gives 15/3 = <<15/3=5>>5 dollars.
Each scoop of ice cream cost 5 dollars

The volume of each raised bed is 2 * 8 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.
The total volume of all the raised beds is 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.
Bob will need 320 / 2 = 160 bags of potting soil.
The total cost will be 160 * $12 = $1920.","Each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet high, so they each hold 2 * 8 * 2 = <<2*8*2=32>>32 cubic feet of dirt.

The total volume of soil needed is 32 cubic feet/bed x 10 beds = 320 cubic feet.
Bob will need 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags of potting soil.
The total cost will be 160 bags x $12/bag = $1920.

Question: Bob needs to buy potting soil to fill the raised beds in his vegetable garden. He has 10 raised beds, and each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall. Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil and costs $12. How much will the potting soil cost him?","First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume of a rectangular prism (raised bed) is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height. 

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 8 ft * 2 ft * 2 ft
Volume = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 beds, the total volume of potting soil needed is:
Total Volume = 32 cubic feet/bed * 10 beds
Total Volume = 320 cubic feet

Since each bag contains 2 cubic feet of soil, Bob will need:
Number of bags = Total Volume / Volume per bag
Number of bags = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag
Number of bags = 160 bags

The total cost of the potting soil will be:
Total Cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total Cost = 160 bags * $12/bag
Total Cost = $1920

Therefore, the potting soil will cost Bob $1920.","Each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet high, so they each hold 2 * 8 * 2 = <<2*8*2=32>>32 cubic feet of dirt.
He has 10 beds, so he will need 10 * 32 = <<10*32=320>>320 cubic feet of dirt.
Each bag of soil is 0.75 cubic feet, so Bob will need 320 / 2 = <<320/2=160>>160 bags of soil.
