Math,0,"Question: Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, and Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia. If Arelia has $120, how much would each have if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them?","First, let's find out how much money Kassidy and Rayna have.

Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, Kassidy has 3/4 * $120 = $90.

Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so Rayna has $90 + $60 = $150.

Therefore, the total amount of money they have is $120 (Aurelia) + $90 (Kassidy) + $150 (Rayna) = $360.

If they decide to share equally among them, each would receive $360 / 3 people = $120. 

So, Aurelia, Kassidy, and Rayna would each have $120.","Since Arelia has $120, and Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money Arelia, Kassidy has 3/4*$120 = $<<3/4*120=90>>90
The total amount of, money Kassidy and Arelia have together is $90+$120 = $<<90+120=210>>210
Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, and since Kassidy has $90, Rayna has $60+$90 = $<<60+90=150>>150
The three of them together has $210+$150 = $<<210+150=360>>360
If they decide to add up their money and share equally, each person would receive $360/3= $<<360/3=120>>120

Math,1a,"Question: Jake's neighbors hire him to mow their lawn and plant some flowers. Mowing the lawn takes 1 hour and pays $15. If Jake wants to make $20/hour working for the neighbors, and planting the flowers takes 2 hours, how much should Jake charge (in total, not per hour) for planting the flowers?
Answer: First figure out how many hours total Jake works by adding the time spent mowing the lawn to the time spent planting flowers: 1 hour + 2 hours = <<1+2=3>>3 hours
Then figure out how much money Jake makes if he earns $20/hour for three hours by multiplying the time spent by the pay rate: $20/hour * 3 hours = $<<20*3=60>>60
Then subtract the money Jake gets paid for mowing the lawn from the total to find how much he should charge in total for planting the flowers: $60 - $15 = $<<60-15=45>>45

Question: The distance across a country is 8205 kilometers. Amelia started at one end and drove 907 kilometers on Monday and 582 kilometers on Tuesday. How many kilometers does Amelia still have to drive to make it across the country?
Answer: Distance driven = 907 + 582 = <<907+582=1489>>1489 km
Distance remaining = 8205 - 1489 = <<8205-1489=6716>>6716 km
Amelia still has 6716 kilometers to drive.

Math,1b,"Question: Jordan is a hockey goalie. In the first period of a game, he blocked four shots. In the second period, he blocked twice as many shots. In the third period, he blocked three fewer than in the second period. When the game ended after the fourth period, he had blocked 21 shots in all. How many did Jordan block in the fourth period?
Answer: Let F be the number of shots Jordan blocked in the fourth period.
In the second period, he blocked 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 shots.
In the third period, he blocked 8 - 3 = <<8-3=5>>5 shots.
In the whole game, he blocked 4 + 8 + 5 + F = 17 + F = 21 shots.
Thus, Jordan blocked F = 21 - 17 = <<21-17=4>>4 shots in the fourth period.

Answer: Tony can skip at twice the speed that Bruce can, for a speed of 1*2=<<1*2=2>>2 miles per hour.
Brandon can skip at one-third the speed that Tony can, for a speed of 2*(1/3) = 2/3 miles per hour.
