Math,1a,"A: Ahmed has read half the number of books as Ezra, so Ahmed has read 300 / 2 = 150 books.
Ezra decided to read 150 more books, so together they have read 300 + 150 = 450 books.
Altogether, they have read 150 + 300 = 450 + 150 = <<150+300+150=600>>600 books. 
#### 600","If Ezra has read 300 books this hour and decided to read 150 more in the next hour, he has read a total of 300+150=<<300+150=450>>450
Since Ezra reads twice as many books as Ahmed, Ahmed has read 450/2=<<450/2=225>>225 books.
Together, Ahmed and Ezra has read 225+450=<<225+450=675>>675 books

Math,1a,"A: Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, Ahmed has read 300/2 = 150 books.
After deciding to read 150 more books, Ezra has read a total of 300 + 150 = <<300+150=450>>450 books.
Adding Ahmed's 150 books, they have read a total of 450 + 150 = <<450+150=600>>600 books altogether.

Math,2,"A: If Ezra read 300 books in one hour and decided to read 150 more, he read a total of 300 + 150 = <<300+150=450>>450 books.
Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in the first hour, Ahmed read 300 / 2 = <<300/2=150>>150 books in the first hour.
Therefore, Ezra and Ahmed have read a total of 450 + 150 = <<450+150=600>>600 books altogether.
