Math,1a,"Question: Addilynn went to the grocery store and bought six dozen eggs for use in her house. After two weeks, she used half of the eggs, then accidentally broke 15 of the remaining eggs while moving them to clean the shelves. How many eggs are left on the shelf?
Answer: Since a dozen has 12 eggs, the total number of eggs that Addilynn bought is 6 dozen * 12 eggs/dozen = <<6*12=72>>72 eggs.
If she used half of the eggs, the number of eggs left is 72 eggs / 2 = <<72/2=36>>36 eggs.
While moving the eggs to clean the shelves, she broke 15 eggs, leaving 36 eggs - 15 eggs = <<36-15=21>>21 eggs.

Question: A group of people pays $720 for admission tickets to an amusement park. The price of an adult ticket is $15, and a child ticket is $8. There are 25 more adults than children. How many children are in the group?
Answer: Let X be the number of children in the group.
The number of adults in the group is X+<<+25=25>>25.
The group pays 8*X + 15*(X+25) = $720.
Multiplying through the parentheses, we get 8X + 15X + 375 = $720
Combining like terms, we get 23X + 375 = 720
Subtracting 375 from both sides, we get 23X = 720 - 375 = $345
Dividing both sides by 23, we get X = $345 / 23 = <<345/23=15>>15 children.

Q: There are 50 books in a small library. Half of them are written in English, and 10% in German. All others are written in Spanish. How many Spanish books are there?","A: Half of the books are written in English, which means there are 50 books / 2 = <<50/2=25>>25 English books.
10% of the books are written in German, which means there are 50 books * 10% = <<50*10*.01=5>>5 German books.
So, the total number of English and German books is 25 English books + 5 German books = <<25+5=30>>30 books.
This means there are 50 total books - 30 English and German books = <<50-30=20>>20 Spanish books in the library. 
Therefore, there are 20 Spanish books in the library.","Half of the books are in English, which means 50 * 0.5 = <<50*0.5=25>>25 books.
German books make up to 10%, which means there are 10/100 * 50 = <<10/100*50=5>>5 of them.
So as a result there are 50 - 25 - 5 = <<50-25-5=20>>20 Spanish books in the library.

Math,1a,"Question: The leak in Jerry's roof drips 3 drops a minute into the pot he put under it. Each drop is 20 ml, and the pot holds 3 liters. How long will it take the pot to be full?
Answer: First find the pot's volume in ml: 3 liters * 1000 ml/liter = <<3*1000=3000>>3000 ml
Then find the number of ml that enter the pot per minute: 3 drops/minute * 20 ml/drop = <<3*20=60>>60 ml/minute
Then divide the volume of the pot by the volume that enters it every minute: 3000 ml / 60 ml/minute = <<3000/60=50>>50 minutes

Question: Barbara Blackburn can type 212 words per minute.  Due to Carpal tunnel syndrome, Barbara cannot use her left hand for a while so her typing speed is now 40 words less per minute. If she is supposed to type a document with 3440 words, how many minutes will it take her to finish typing the document?
Answer: Due to carpal tunnel syndrome, Barbara can only type 212 - 40= <<212-40=172>>172 words per minute.
So, she will be able to finish typing the document in 3440/172 = <<3440/172=20>>20 minutes.

Q: There are 50 books in a small library. Half of them are written in English, and 10% in German. All others are written in Spanish. How many Spanish books are there?","A: Half of 50 books is 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 books written in English.
10% of 50 is 50 * 0.10 = <<50*0.10=5>>5 books written in German.
So, the total number of books written in English or German is 25 + 5 = <<25+5=30>>30 books.
Therefore, the number of Spanish books in the library is 50 - 30 = <<50-30=20>>20 books.","Half of the books are in English, which means 50 * 0.5 = <<50*0.5=25>>25 books.

Then find the number of ml that enter the pot per minute: 3 drops/minute * 20 ml/drop = <<3*20=60>>60 ml/minute
