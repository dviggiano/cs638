Math,0,"Question: Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, how many cents will she have left?","Kelly has a total of 5 quarters, which is equal to 5 * 25 = 125 cents.
She also has 2 dimes, which is equal to 2 * 10 = 20 cents.
So, Kelly has a total of 125 + 20 = 145 cents.
After buying a can of pop for 55 cents, Kelly will have 145 - 55 = 90 cents left.","Her quarters are worth 5 * 25 = <<5*25=125>>125 cents.
The dimes are worth 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 cents
Kelly has a total of 125 + 20 = <<125+20=145>>145 cents
After buying the can of pop, Kelly will have 145 - 55 = <<145-55=90>>90 cents left.

Math,1a,"Question: A candy store uses food colouring in various candies. Each lollipop uses 5ml of food colouring, and each hard candy also needs food colouring. In one day, the candy store makes 100 lollipops and 5 hard candies. They do not use food colouring in anything else. The store has used 600ml of food colouring by the end of the day. How much food colouring, in millilitres, does each hard candy need?
Answer: In total, the lollipops needed 5ml of food colouring * 100 lollipops = <<5*100=500>>500ml of food colouring.
This means that the hard candies needed 600ml total food colouring – 500ml food colouring for lollipops = 100ml of food colouring.
So each hard candy needed 100ml of food colouring / 5 hard candies = <<100/5=20>>20 ml of food colouring.

Question: Louise is baking cakes for a gathering. She needs 60 cakes in total, and has already produced half this many. Today, she calculates how many cakes she has left to make and bakes half this amount. The next day, she again calculates how many cakes she has left to make and bakes a third of this amount. How many more cakes does Louise need to bake?
Answer: Louise has already produced 60 cakes / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 cakes.
After calculating how many cakes are left, she bakes another 30 cakes / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 cakes.
The next day, she calculates again then bakes another 15 cakes / 3 = <<15/3=5>>5 cakes.
She therefore still needs to bake 60 – 30 – 15 – 5 = <<60-30-15-5=10>>10 cakes.

Question: Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, how many cents will she have left?","Answer: Kelly has a total of 5 quarters * 25 cents/quarter + 2 dimes * 10 cents/dime = 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents. 
After buying a can of pop for 55 cents, she will have 145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents left.
Therefore, Kelly will have 90 cents left.","Her quarters are worth 5 * 25 = <<5*25=125>>125 cents.
The dimes are worth 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 cents
Kelly has a total of 125 + 20 = <<125+20=145>>145 cents
After buying the can of pop, Kelly will have 145 - 55 = <<145-55=90>>90 cents left.

Math,1b,"Question: Alfonso earns $6 each day walking his aunt’s dog. He is saving to buy a mountain bike helmet for $340. Currently, he already has $40. If he walks his aunt's dog 5 days a week, in how many weeks should Alfonso work to buy his mountain bike?
Answer: Alfonso has to work for the $340 - $40 = $<<300=300>>300.
In a week, he earns $6 x 5 = $<<6*5=30>>30.
Thus, he needs to work $300/$30 = <<300/30=10>>10 weeks to buy the bike.
