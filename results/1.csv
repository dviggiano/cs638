Math,1a,"Q: In a 5-day Fishing competition, Jackson was able to reel a total of 6 fishes per day, Jonah was able to reel 4 fishes per day and George was able to reel 8 fishes per day. How many fishes were they able to catch throughout the competition if they are on the same team?
A: Jackson gets a total of 6x5= <<6*5=30>>30 fishes after the competition.
Jonah gets 4x5= <<4*5=20>>20 fishes after the competition.
And George was able to get 8x5=<<8*5=40>>40 fishes after the competition.

Q: Karen is paddling her canoe up a river against the current. On a still pond, Karen can paddle 10 miles per hour. The river flows in the opposite direction at 4 miles per hour. If the river is 12 miles long, how many hours will it take Karen to paddle up it?
A: First find Karen's net speed by subtracting the speed of the current: 10 mph - 4 mph = <<10-4=6>>6 mph
Then divide the length of the river by Karen's speed to find how long it takes her to paddle up it: 12 miles / 6 mph = <<12/6=2>>2 hours

Q: Mr. Sergio is a fruit grower producing apples, mangoes and oranges. In a particular season, the total produce of apples was twice the total produce of mangoes, and the total produce of oranges was 200 kg more than that of mangoes. If his farm produced 400 kg of mangoes and he sold the fruits at $50 per kg,  calculate the total amount of money he got in that season.
A: If the total production of mangoes was 400, then orange production was 400+200 = <<400+200=600>>600 kg of oranges.
Since apple production was twice the total production of mangoes, Mr. Sergio had 2*400 = <<2*400=800>>800 kg of apples.
The total quantity of fruits produced at Mr. Sergio's farm is 800 kg of apples+600 kg of oranges + 400 kg of mangoes = <<800+600+400=1800>>1800 kg of fruits.
If Mr. Sergio sold the fruits at $50 per kg, his total income from the sales is 1800*$50 = $<<1800*50=90000>>90000.

Q: Janice bought five juices for $10 in total and two sandwiches for $6 in total. How much would she need to pay, if she would only buy one sandwich and one juice?
A: Janice bought five juices for $10, so one juice costs 10 / 5 = $<<10/5=2>>2.
She also bought two sandwiches for $6, so one sandwich costs 6 / 2 = $<<6/2=3>>3.
So for one juice and one sandwich, Janice would need to pay 2 + 3 = $<<2+3=5>>5.

Q: May can knit 3 scarves using one yarn. She bought 2 red yarns, 6 blue yarns, and 4 yellow yarns. How many scarves will she be able to make in total?
A: May will be able to make 2 x 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 red scarves.
She will be able to make 3 x 6 = <<3*6=18>>18 blue scarves.
And she will be able to make 4 x 3 = <<4*3=12>>12 yellow scarves.
Therefore the total scarves she can make is 12 + 18 + 6 = <<12+18+6=36>>36.

Q: Johnson has a sack of potatoes. He gives Gina 69 potatoes, gives Tom twice as much potatoes as he gave Gina and gives one-third of the amount of potatoes he gave Tom to Anne. How many potatoes does he have left if the sack contains 300 potatoes?
A: He gives twice 69 potatoes to Tom, which is 69*2 = <<69*2=138>>138 potatoes
He gives one-third of 138 potatoes to Anne, which is 138*(1/3) = <<138*(1/3)=46>>46 potatoes
In total, he has given out 69+138+46 = <<69+138+46=253>>253 potatoes
He initially had 300 potatoes so he now has 300-253 = <<300-253=47>>47 potatoes left

Q: A factory uses robots to manufacture batteries. For each battery that is made, it takes a robot 6 minutes to gather the materials for the battery and 9 minutes to create the battery. If the factory has 10 robots working on batteries at the same time, how many batteries can the robots manufacture in 5 hours?
A: For each battery that a robot makes, it takes 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 minutes to create the battery.
In 60 minutes, one robot can make 60 / 15 = <<60/15=4>>4 batteries per hour.
If the factory uses 10 robots at the same time, then they can produce 10 * 4 = <<10*4=40>>40 batteries per hour.
At a rate of 40 batteries per hour, 10 robots can produce 40 * 5 = <<40*5=200>>200 batteries in 5 hours.

Q: Megan is making food for a party.  She has to spend 20 minutes preparing one dish in the oven.  Each dish can feed 5 people.  She spends 2 hours preparing as many of these dishes as she can for the party.  How many people can she feed with these dishes?
A: First, we need to determine the total amount of minutes available for cooking. We do this by performing 2*60=<<2*60=120>>120, as there are 60 minutes in an hour.
Now that we know we have 120 minutes, we then divide the preparation time into the total amount of time by performing 120/20= <<120/20=6>>6 dishes capable of being made.
Since each dish can feed 5 people, we find the total number of people fed by performing 5*6=<<5*6=30>>30 people.

Q: Joanna and Jacques had 40 and 60 gumballs, respectively, in their dishes. They then purchased 4 times the number of gumballs they had initially and added these to their dishes. If they decided to put together their gumballs and shared them equally, how many gumballs did each get?
A: When Joanna purchased 4 times the number of gumballs she initially had, she added 40*4 = <<4*40=160>>160 gumballs to her dish.
The total number of gumballs Joanna had in her dish after buying 160 more is 160+40 = <<160+40=200>>200
At the same time, Jacques bought 60*4 = <<60*4=240>>240 new gumballs.
When Jacques added his new 240 gumballs to his dish, the total number of gumballs increased to 240+60 = <<240+60=300>>300 gumballs.
When they decided to put together their gumballs, they had 300+200 = <<300+200=500>>500 gumballs altogether.
After sharing equally, each person got 500/2 = <<500/2=250>>250 gumballs.

Q: Philip is a painter. He makes 2 paintings per day. If he already has 20 paintings, how many paintings in total will he have after 30 days?
A: The number of paintings Philip will make after 30 days is 2 paints/day * 30 days = <<2*30=60>>60 paintings.
Then, the total number of his paintings will be 60 paintings + 20 paintings = <<60+20=80>>80 paintings.

Q: A factory uses robots to manufacture batteries. For each battery that is made, it takes a robot 6 minutes to gather the materials for the battery and 9 minutes to create the battery. If the factory has 10 robots working on batteries at the same time, how many batteries can the robots manufacture in 5 hours?
A: For each battery that a robot makes, it takes 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 minutes to create the battery.
In 60 minutes, one robot can make 60 / 15 = <<60/15=4>>4 batteries per hour.
If the factory uses 10 robots at the same time, then they can produce 10 * 4 = <<10*4=40>>40 batteries per hour.
At a rate of 40 batteries per hour, 10 robots can produce 40 * 5 = <<40*5=200>>200 batteries in 5 hours.

Q: Megan is making food for a party.  She has to spend 20 minutes preparing one dish in the oven.  Each dish can feed 5 people.  She spends 2 hours preparing as many of these dishes as she can for the party.  How many people can she feed with these dishes?
A: First, we need to determine the total amount of minutes available for cooking. We do this by performing 2*60=<<2*60=120>>120, as there are 60 minutes in an hour.
Now that we know we have 120 minutes, we then divide the preparation time into the total amount of time by performing 120/20= <<120/20=6>>6 dishes capable of being made.
Since each dish can feed 5 people, we find the total number of people fed by performing 5*6=<<5*6=30>>30 people.

Q: Joanna and Jacques had 40 and 60 gumballs, respectively, in their dishes. They then purchased 4 times the number of gumballs they had initially and added these to their dishes. If they decided to put together their gumballs and shared them equally, how many gumballs did each get?
A: When Joanna purchased 4 times the number of gumballs she initially had, she added 40*4 = <<4*40=160>>160 gumballs to her dish.
The total number of gumballs Joanna had in her dish after buying 160 more is 160+40 = <<160+40=200>>200
At the same time, Jacques bought 60*4 = <<60*4=240>>240 new gumballs.
When Jacques added his new 240 gumballs to his dish, the total number of gumballs increased to 240+60 = <<240+60=300>>300 gumballs.
When they decided to put together their gumballs, they had 300+200 = <<300+200=500>>500 gumballs altogether.
After sharing equally, each person got 500/2 = <<500/2=250>>250 gumballs.

Q: Two companies A and B, are selling bottled milk. Company A sells a big bottle for $4 and Company B sells a big bottle for $3.5. Company A was able to sell 300 and company B 350 big bottles of milk. How much more money did one company make from the other?
A: Company A earned 300 * 4 = $<<300*4=1200>>1200 for big bottles of milk.
Company B earned 350 * 3.5 = $<<350*3.5=1225>>1225 for big bottles of milk.
Company B earned 1225 - 1200 = $<<1225-1200=25>>25 more than company A.
