Math,0,Question: Ashley's pizza delivery costs $15. What is the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man if she wants to give a tip that is equal to 1/5 of the amount she ordered?,"Ashley ordered $15 worth of pizza. 

1/5 of $15 is $3. 

To give a tip that is equal to 1/5 of the amount she ordered, Ashley should give the delivery man $3. 

Therefore, the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man is $15 (cost of pizza) + $3 (tip) = $18.","The tip that Ashley wants to give amounts to $15 x 1/5 = $<<15*1/5=3>>3.
Hence, she will give a total of $15 + $3 = $<<15+3=18>>18 to the delivery man.

Math,1a,"Question: There were 80 cars in a parking lot. At lunchtime, 13 cars left the parking lot but 5 more cars went in than left. How many cars are in the parking lot now?
Answer: There are 80 - 13 = <<80-13=67>>67 cars in the parking lot after 13 went out.
13 + 5 = <<13+5=18>>18 cars went in the parking lot at lunchtime.
So, there are 67 + 18 = <<67+18=85>>85 cars in the parking lot now.

Question: Nancy carves statues out of jade. A giraffe statue takes 120 grams of jade and sells for $150. An elephant statue takes twice as much jade and sells for $350. If Nancy has 1920 grams of jade, how much more money will she make turning it all into elephants instead of giraffes?
Answer: First find how many giraffe statues Nancy can make by dividing the total amount of jade by the amount used per giraffe statue: 1920 g / 120 g/giraffe = <<1920/120=16>>16 giraffes
Then multiply that number by the price per giraffe to find how much Nancy earns total from giraffes: 16 giraffes * $150/giraffe = $<<16*150=2400>>2400
Then find how much jade each elephant statue uses by doubling the jade used by the giraffe statues: 120 g/giraffe * 2 = <<120*2=240>>240 g/elephant
Then find how many elephant statues Nancy can make by dividing the total amount of jade by the amount used per elephant statue: 1920 g / 240 g/elephant = <<1920/240=8>>8 elephant
Multiply that number by the price per elephant to find Nancy's total earnings from elephants: 8 elephants * $350/elephant = $<<8*350=2800>>2800
Finally, subtract Nancy's total earnings from the giraffes from her total earnings from the elephants to find the difference: $2800 - $2400 = $<<2800-2400=400>>400

Question: Ashley's pizza delivery costs $15. What is the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man if she wants to give a tip that is equal to 1/5 of the amount she ordered?","Answer: To find the tip amount, first calculate 1/5 of the total bill: $15 * 1/5 = $<<15*1/5=3>>3
Then add that amount to the cost of the pizza delivery to find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man: $15 + $3 = $<<15+3=18>>18
Therefore, Ashley should give the delivery man a total of $18.","The tip that Ashley wants to give amounts to $15 x 1/5 = $<<15*1/5=3>>3.
Hence, she will give a total of $15 + $3 = $<<15+3=18>>18 to the delivery man.

Math,1b,"Question: Giselle is in charge of the relay run on track and field day. Last year, the race was 300 meters. This year, it will be 4 times as long. Giselle needs to set up 6 tables for the relay run. The distance between the tables must be the same and the last table will be at the finish line. What is the distance between table 1 and table 3 in meters?
Answer: The relay run is 4 times the length of last year’s race, so 300 meters x 4 = <<300*4=1200>>1200 meters.
With 6 tables along the route, the distance between tables is 1200 meters / 6 tables = <<1200/6=200>>200 meters.
The distance between tables 1 and 3 is 200 meters x 2 = <<200*2=400>>400 meters.
