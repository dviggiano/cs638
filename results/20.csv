Math,1a,"Question: Liz sold her car at 80% of what she originally paid. She uses the proceeds of that sale and needs only $4,000 to buy herself a new $30,000 car. How much cheaper is her new car versus what she originally paid for her old one?
Answer: If Liz needs only $4,000 to buy a new $30,000 car, that means she has $30,000-$4,000=$<<30000-4000=26000>>26,000 from the proceeds of selling her old car
If she sold her car at 80% of what she originally paid for and sold it for $26,000 then she originally paid $26,000/80% = $32,500 for her old car
If she paid $32,500 for her old car and the new one is $30,000 then, the new one is $32,500-$30,000 = $<<32500-30000=2500>>2,500 cheaper

Question: Carol is an aviation engineer deciding how much fuel to put in a jet. The empty plane needs 20 gallons of fuel per mile. Each person on the plane increases this amount by 3 gallons per mile, and each bag increases it by 2 gallons per mile. If there are 30 passengers and 5 flight crew, and each person brought two bags, how many gallons of fuel does the plane need for a 400-mile trip?
Answer: First find the total number of people by adding the number of passengers and flight crew: 30 people + 5 people = <<30+5=35>>35 people
Then find the total number of bags by doubling the total number of people: 35 people * 2 bags/person = <<35*2=70>>70 bags
Then find the fuel increase caused by the people by multiplying their number by the fuel increase per person: 35 people * 3 gallons/mile/person = <<35*3=105>>105 gallons/mile
Then multiply the number of bags by the fuel increase per bag to find the total fuel increase they cause: 70 bags * 2 gallons/mile/bag = <<70*2=140>>140 gallons/mile
Now add the fuel increases to the base fuel consumption to find the total fuel needed per mile: 140 gallons/mile + 105 gallons/mile + 20 gallons/mile = <<140+105+20=265>>265 gallons/mile
Now multiply the fuel consumption per mile by the number of miles flown to find the total amount of fuel needed: 265 gallons/mile * 400 miles = <<265*400=106000>>106,000 gallons of fuel

After the water balloon fight, they had 12 balloons left, so they must have thrown 300 - 12 = <<300-12=288>>288 balloons.
Therefore, Jolene and her friends threw a total of 288 water balloons during the fight.","They started off with 10 packs of balloons that had 30 balloons each for a total of 10*30 = <<10*30=300>>300 balloons

Answer: If Liz needs only $4,000 to buy a new $30,000 car, that means she has $30,000-$4,000=$<<30000-4000=26000>>26,000 from the proceeds of selling her old car
