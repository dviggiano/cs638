Math,0,Question: Lorie earns $10 per hour. Karen earns twice what Lorie earns. How much does Karen earn in two days if she works 3 hours per day?,"Karen earns $20 per hour (twice what Lorie earns).

If Karen works 3 hours per day, she earns $20 * 3 = $60 per day.

In two days, Karen earns $60/day * 2 days = $120. 

Therefore, Karen earns $120 in two days working 3 hours per day.","Karen earns $10 x 2 = $<<10*2=20>>20 per hour.
So she earns $20 x 3 = $<<20*3=60>>60 per day.
Thus, she earns $60 x 2 = $<<60*2=120>>120 in two days.

Math,1a,"Question: The faucet in Betsy's bathroom is broken. Every minute it drips about 10 times. What amount of water is wasted during one hour if each drop contains 0.05 mL?
Answer: Every minute, 10 * 0.05 = <<10*0.05=0.5>>0.5 mL of water are wasted.

Question: Jennie drives to her son’s house in 5 hours when there is heavy traffic. When there is no traffic the same trip takes only 4 hours. If her son's house is 200 miles away, what is the difference between her average speed when there is heavy traffic and when there is no traffic?
Answer: Jennie can cover the 200-mile distance in 5 hours when there is heavy traffic, so her average speed is 200/5 = <<200/5=40>>40mph
She can cover the same distance in 4 hours when there is no traffic for an average speed of 200/4 = <<200/4=50>>50mph
The difference in average speed between the two scenarios is (50-40)mph = <<(50-40)=10>>10mph

Math,1b,"Question: One serving of soup has 1 cup of vegetables and 2.5 cups of broth. How many pints of vegetables and broth combined would be needed for 8 servings?
Answer: One serving = 1 + 2.5 = <<1+2.5=3.5>>3.5 cups

Question: If a basket is capable of holding 40 fruit altogether, and there are 3 times as many apples as oranges, how many oranges are there?
Answer: Since the ratio of apples to oranges is 3:1, that means for every 3 apples there is 1 orange. The size of this group is therefore 3+1=<<3+1=4>>4.
We then divide this group size into the total amount of fruit the basket is holding at this time, which is 40. This means there are 40/4=<<40/4=10>>10 of these groups in total.
Since there are 10 of these groups in total, that means there are 10*1=<<10*1=10>>10 oranges in the basket.
